\subsection{Modeling the Quantum Gain Medium}
\todo[inline]{Primer on SALT and its derivation for TM/TE modes.}      

\subsection{Variable Phase Method}
\todo[inline]{Primer on VPM for bidimensional cavities (mention its
	      use for 3D cavities with vector spherical wave functions).}
\todo[inline]{Motivation for VPM: computing the field more efficiently than in SQA.}

\section{Antenna Propagation}

\todo[inline]{Describe goal of project; advantages of using fibers
	      over patch antennae...}
	      
\subsection{Antenna Theory Primer}
\todo[inline]{Basic definitions of directivity, gain...}
\todo[inline]{Stratton solution}

\subsection{Designs}

\todo[inline]{Feasability of design via dipole antenna. Analytical solution
	      of dipole antenna. Issue with thin silver shells.}

\todo[inline]{Theory of infinite LCXs as guide for finite LCX. Discuss in more
	      detail about the thin silver shells (methods used to model them,
	      non-agreement with experimental data and its probable causes).
	      Discuss Bruggemann's model and Fuchs-Sondheimer methods.}
