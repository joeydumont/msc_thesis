\chapter{Active Media and Radiation}
The previous chapter set the stage for the study of 
the scattering of light on general, albeit passive, 
potentials. The relative simplicity of the geometry
and of the physics allowed for a solution rich 
in physical information and lead to a rather simple
numerical solution. 

In the first section, we test the limits of the our analytical formalism
and of our numerical advances. To more accurately model
microlasers, we model the interaction of light with the underlying
quantum gain medium, i.e. we solve the Maxwell-Bloch, or Schrödinger-Bloch, 
matter equations. We will specifically use the \gls{salt}, a recently 
formulated steady state laser theory. In this theory, the effect 
of the active medium is reduced to an additional frequency and pump-dependent
term in the refractive index. This extra term has a Lorentzian frequency
dependence, as physically expected, and has non-zero real and imaginary
parts. The fragility of our extension of SQA is then exposed and some replacement
methods are suggested. 


The second section studies the experimental response
of different realizations of a specific type of antenna
known as \glspl{lcx}. The genesis of this study lies in
the hopes of designing an antenna that can be seamlessly
integrated into textile. The sheer complexity of the
antenna, as we will show, bars the use of the methods developed
in this essay in favour of the all-numerical \gls{fem}. 
This particular choice will be motivated and the design 
parameters of the antenna thoroughly explained. 

\section{Lasing and Scattering}
A recently formulated laser theory, named the 
\gls{salt} and developed by A. D. Stone's group
at Yale, has been shown to be an accurate model 
of the light-matter interaction involved in bidimensional
microlasers. Its steady-state nature allows us to apply
the formalism developed in the previous section 
to the theory. However, in light of the several shortcomings
of the \gls{sqa}'s numerical implementation, we have studied 
two other numerical methods. The first one, the \gls{vpm}, is based on 
differential equations and shares some of the problems of 
the onion method, but has a nice physical interpretation
in terms of phases and is more easily generalizable to 
3D scattering. 
To find a more robust solution, we completely forgo 
differential equations in favour of integral ones. 
Our brief incursion into the rich field of integral equations
is a rather recent one, and might leave the reader hungry for more.

\subsection{Primer on Steady State ab initio Laser Theory (SALT)}
Our exposition of \gls{salt} will be divided into two main sections:
the first will describe the details of the interaction of light with
the quantum gain medium and provide a steady-state solution
of the resulting Maxwell-Bloch equations. The second
will discuss the constant-flux states and their computation
using the aforementioned numerical methods. 

\paragraph{Solving the Matter Equations}
Our starting point, as always, is
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\times\bo{E}	&= ik\mu\bo{H};	&	\nabla\times\bo{H}	&= -ik\epsilon\bo{E}-ik\bo{P}^{NL}
  \end{align}
where $\bo{P}^{NL}$ now represents the possibly non-linear response
of the underlying quantum gain medium to the electric field $\bo{E}$.
We separate the fields in transverse and longitudinal
components, as we did for the passive cavities. Assuming 
that the propagation constant $\beta$ vanishes, we can 
separate two polarization states and write decoupled differential
equations for the longitudinal components of the fields
	\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2\right]E_z	&= \frac{1}{\mu}\nabla E_z\cdot\nabla\mu -k^2\mu P_z	\tag{\theequation.TM}\\
		\left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2\right]H_z	&= \frac{1}{\epsilon}\nabla H_z\cdot\nabla\epsilon-
											\frac{ik}{\epsilon}\bo{P}^{NL}\times\nabla\epsilon
											-ik\nabla\times\bo{P}^{NL}							\tag{\theequation.TE}\label{eq:active.salt.TEeqn}
	\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
where the last equation is the \textit{proper} generalization for TE modes. 
To derive these equations, we made the implicit assumptions that the 
non-linear electric susceptibility tensor, 
	\begin{equation}
		\bo{P}^{NL} = \bo{\chi_e}^{NL}(\bo{r};\omega)\bo{E}(\bo{r}),
	\end{equation}
is at least a diagonal tensor, or a scalar. In the TM polarization, 
$E_r=E_\theta=0\Rightarrow P_r=P_\theta=0$, such that $\bo{P}^{NL}$
has a single non-zero component, while in the TE polarization only
the $P_r$ and $P_\theta$ components are non-zero. The vectors resulting
from the cross-product and curl in \eqref{eq:active.salt.TEeqn} possess
only a $z$-component, as needed. 

To go any further, we must compute the value of the non-linear electric
susceptibility tensor. 
To show the main features of the theory, we assume a two-level quantum 
system as the gain medium, although the method is generalizable to 
multi-level systems \cite[\S2.3]{GE2010b}.

	 rate from level 2 to level 1 is given by $1/\Gamma_{21}$.}
 \label{fig:active.salt.twoLevelSystem}
\end{figure}

Solving Schrödinger's equation for a ``bare'', i.e. non-interacting
two-level system yields
  \begin{equation}
   H_0\Ket{\psi}=\omega_j\Ket{\psi}	\qquad j=0,1
  \end{equation}
and corresponding eigenfunctions $\Ket{1}$ and $\Ket{2}$. 
The incoming light field acts as a perturbation and source of energy
that stimulates a population transfer from level 1 to level 2 that decay
at rate $1/\gamma_\parallel$. The perturbation can be written as
  \begin{equation}
   H_1 = e\bo{\mu}\cdot\bo{E}
  \end{equation}
where $e$ is the electric charge and $\bo{\mu}$ is the 
dipole moment tensor of the material.  We expand the solution 
of the perturbed in the states of the unperturbed system
  \begin{equation}
   \Ket{\psi_1(t)}=C_1(t)\Ket{1}+C_2(t)\Ket{2}
  \end{equation}
and form the density matrix
  \begin{equation}
   \rho(t) = \Ket{\psi_1(t)}\Bra{\psi_1(t)}.
  \end{equation}
It allows us to solve the problem for an ensemble
of two-level systems \cite{GE2010b}.
Using the well-known evolution equations of the density
matrix \cite[\S6.2]{BOY2008} and defining
$D=\rho_{22}-\rho_{11}$, the population difference between the two
levels,  we obtain the equations
\cite[\S5.3]{HAK1985b}
  \begin{align}
   \dot{\bo{P}}^{NL}	&= -\left(i\omega+\gamma_\perp\right)\bo{P}^{NL}+\frac{g^2}{i\hbar}\bo{E}D	\\
   \dot{D}				&= \gamma_\parallel\left(D_0-D\right)-\frac{2}{i\hbar}\bo{E}\cdot\bo{P}^{NL}
  \end{align}
where $g^2$ is the dipole moment of the system, 
$\gamma_\perp$ is an \textit{ad hoc} phenomenological damping
term that comes from the interaction of the ensemble of systems\footnote{The author surmises that it 
could be computed with a mean field approximation.}
and $D_0$ is the equilibrium population. The approach 
uses a \gls{rwa}, but, contrary 
to most derivations, does not invoke the \gls{svea}. 
One of the main approximations, one that is necessary to make
ground, is the \gls{sia}, i.e. $\dot{D}=0$. Writing the fields
as Fourier series
	\begin{align*}
		\bo{P}^{NL}	&= \sum_{\mu}\bo{p}_\mu e^{-ik_\mu t}	&	\bo{E}	&= \sum_{\mu} \bo{\Psi}_\mu e^{-ik_\mu t}
	\end{align*}
leads to the relationship\footnote{We have skipped some steps. See \cite[\S2.2]{GE2010b} for details.}
  \begin{equation}
   \bo{p}_\mu = \frac{g^2}{\hbar}\frac{1}{k_\mu-k+i\gamma_\perp}\frac{D(\bo{r})}{1+\sum\frac{4g^2}{\gamma_\perp\gamma_\parallel}\Gamma(k_\mu)\left|\Psi_\mu(\bo{r})\right|^2}\bo{\Psi}_\mu(\bo{r}).
  \end{equation}
In the TM polarization, this leads to the equation
  \begin{equation}
   \left[\nabla^2+k^2\left(\epsilon(\bo{r})+\frac{g^2}{\hbar}\frac{1}{k_\mu-k+i\gamma_\perp}\frac{D(\bo{r})}{1+\sum\frac{4g^2}{\gamma_\perp\gamma_\parallel\Gamma(k_\mu)}\left|\Psi_\mu(\bo{r})\right|^2}\right)\right]\Psi_\mu(\bo{r})=0
  \end{equation}
where
	\begin{equation}
		\Gamma(k_\mu) = \frac{\gamma_\perp^2}{(k-k_\mu)^2-\gamma_\perp^2}.
	\end{equation}

\subsection{Methods of Solution}
\paragraph{Variable Phase Method}
This elegant method has its roots deep in the literature of quantum-mechanical
scattering. It is based on the fact that, for central potentials, the 
\gls{sMatrix} is diagonal and that its elements can be written as
$e^{i\delta_k}$, where $\delta_k$ is the phase shift suffered by the 
$k$th partial wave. One can thus find a first order, non-linear differential
equation \cite{CAL1967} for each $\delta_k$. The method transforms the \gls{bcp} to an \gls{ivp}, as the phase shift
is bounded. In our present case, the potential is not a central one and the
\gls{sMatrix} is not diagonal. We will need to solve a coupled system 
of differential equations to represent the coupling between the different
partial waves. The \gls{vpm} will give rise to an \gls{ivp} matrix \gls{ode}.

The initial motivation for the use of \gls{vpm} was the computation 
of the field inside the scatterer. In the \gls{sqa}, modifying 
the linear algebra operations of the reduction phase yields
an algorithm that computes the field from given $\bo{A}$ and $\bo{B}$
coefficients. It is unfortunately highly unstable, to the point 
of being unusable. The authors of \cite{FOR2012} suggested that
the \gls{vpm} was stable, suggesting its use over the onion
discretization of \gls{sqa}. While the \gls{vpm} has some inherent
issues and our implementation is far from complete, we present
here the main development both for the interested reader and for 
future reference. 

The method starts with the angular momentum expansions
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   H_z(r,\theta)	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\psi_m(r)e^{im\theta}	\\
   n(r,\theta)		&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{m'=-\infty}^\infty n_{m'}(r)e^{im'\theta}.
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
Substituting these expansions in Helmholtz's equation and projecting
onto the eigenstate $\sqrt{r}e^{-im''\theta}/\sqrt{2\pi}$ yields a
system of coupled \glspl{ode} for each moment of the field $\psi_m$
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:active.vpm.equation}
		\bo{\psi}''-\frac{\mat{M}^2-\mat{I}/4}{r^2}\bo{\psi}+\frac{k^2}{2\pi}\mat{N}^2\bo{\psi}=0
	\end{equation}
where 
	\begin{equation*}
		\left[\mat{N}(r)\right]_{mm''}=\sum_{m'}n_{m'}(r)\delta_{m+m',m''}.
	\end{equation*}
Notice that the free case is recovered when $n(r,\theta)=1$, as 
then $n_{m'}=\delta_{m'0}$ and 
	\begin{equation}
		\bo{\psi}''-\frac{\mat{M^2}-\mat{I}/4}{r^2}\bo{\psi}+k^2\bo{\psi}=0
	\end{equation}
a system of uncoupled Bessel equations. At this point, we 
introduce the matrix \gls{ode}, i.e. \eqref{eq:active.vpm.equation} with as many 
rows as columns. Each column solves the ODE, but has different boundary conditions
\cite[\S15.2]{NEW1982}. Since the scattering solution must obey Sommerfeld's radiation
condition, we use the factorization
	\begin{equation}
		\bo{\psi} = \mat{G}_k(r)\mat{W}^{+}(kr)
	\end{equation}
where $\left[\mat{W}^{\omega}(kr)\right]_{mm''}=H_m^{(\omega)}(kr)\delta_{mm''}$.
Outside the \gls{lss}, the solution must be $\mat{W}^+(kr)$. In the general potential
scattering theory, the \gls{lss} is usually a sphere at infinity, which yields the 
initial value conditions
	\begin{align}
		\mat{G}_k(\infty)	&=\mat{I}	&	\mat{G}_k'(\infty)=\mat{0}.
	\end{align}
with 
	\begin{equation}
		\mat{G}_k''+2\mat{G}_k'\frac{d\log\mat{W}^\omega}{dr}+\frac{1}{r^2}\left[\mat{G}_k,\mat{M}^2-\mat{I}/4\right]
					+\frac{k^2}{2\pi}\left(\mat{N}^2-2\pi\mat{I}\right)=0.
	\end{equation}

The $\mat{G}_k(r)$ matrix represents the phase shifts accumulated by each partial wave $m$ 
and caused by the $m'$th angular moment of the potential. The factorization procedure 
effectively transforms the \gls{bcp} to an \gls{ivp}, with the data provided on the 
\gls{lss}. The matrix ODE can thus be solved by using any good integration routine\footnote{Although
make sure you use a stiff equation solver. See Appendix \ref{sec:app.basisEqn.vpm} for details.}.

The scattering matrix of the problem can also be obtained if we 
compute the conjugate solution, solving with the incoming radiation $\bo{\psi}=\mat{G}_{-k}\mat{W}^-(kr)$
instead of the outgoing one. The physical wave function is thus given by 
	\begin{equation}
		\bo{\psi} = \mat{G}_{-k}(r)\mat{W}^-(kr)+\mat{G}_k(r)\mat{W}^+(kr)\mat{S}_k(k).
	\end{equation}
Using the finiteness condition of the field at origin, we have
	\begin{equation}
		\mat{S}_k = -\lim_{r\rightarrow0}\left(\mat{W}^{+}(kr)\right)^{-1}\mat{G}_k^{-1}(r)\mat{G}_{-k}(r)\mat{W}^-(kr).
	\end{equation}

\paragraph{Green's Function Method}
Seeing the differential methods fail, the author of this essay, 
then on the brink of despair, first took notice of the 
power of integral methods. Simply rewriting Helmholtz's 
equation as
  \begin{equation}
   \left[\nabla^2+\epsilon_B(\omega)k^2\right]\psi=-k^2\Delta\epsilon(\bo{r};\omega)\psi
  \end{equation}
where 
  \begin{equation}
  \Delta\epsilon(\bo{r};\omega)=\epsilon(\bo{r};\omega)-\epsilon_B(\omega)
  \end{equation}
where $\epsilon(\bo{r};\omega)$ is the permittivity profile of the scatterer
and $\epsilon_B(\omega)$ the constant permittivity of the environment, or background.
This allows to write a formal solution using the Green's function of Helmholtz's equation
  \begin{equation}
   \psi(\bo{r}) = \phi(\bo{r}) - k^2\mathop{\iint}_\mathcal{C}G(\bo{r},\bo{r}')\Delta\epsilon(\bo{r}';\omega)\psi(\bo{r}')d^2\bo{r}'
  \end{equation}
where $\phi(\bo{r})$ is a solution of the homogeneous problem and
  \begin{equation}
   G_\omega(\bo{r},\bo{r}') = -\frac{i}{4}H_0^{(\omega)}(k\sqrt{\epsilon_B}|\bo{r}-\bo{r}'|)
  \end{equation}
and we use the \textit{outgoing} Green's function $G=G_+$.

Instead of a \gls{pde}, we now must solve an implicit 
integral equation for the field. It is a Fredholm 
equation of the second kind with a weakly singular, compact
operator. This ensures the existence
and uniticity of the solution \cite{GOH1981,COL2013}.
We solve the surface integral equation in real space by meshing
the cavity $\mathcal{C}$. The details of the meshing is left to 
Appendix \ref{sec:app.basisEqn.greenFunction}. Let us denote the set
of cells of our mesh by $\Delta$. We can thus cast the integral
equation as
	\begin{equation}
		\psi_j = \phi_j -k^2\sum_{j'\in\Delta} G_{jj'}\Delta\epsilon_{j'}A_{j'}\psi_{j'}
	\end{equation}
where $\psi_j=\psi(\bo{r}_j)$ and similarly for the other quantities. We can
rewrite this as the matrix problem\footnote{This, of course, only holds if the
kernel is linear.} 
	\begin{equation}
		\left(\mat{I}+\mat{K}\right)\bo{\psi}=\bo{\phi}.
	\end{equation}
where 
	\begin{equation}
		K_{jj'} = G_{jj'}\Delta\epsilon_{j'}A_{j'}.
	\end{equation}

The matrix equation is then solved using any good 
linear algebra solver. This yields values for the
field inside the scatterer. The integral equation
is then explicit for the field outside the scatterer. 
Our interest, however, still lies in the computation
of the scattering matrix. It turns out that, if we
use 
	\begin{equation}
		\phi = J_M(kr)e^{iM\theta}
	\end{equation}
as the ``incoming'' field, one may find that the scattering
matrix can be computed via
	\begin{equation}
		S_{mM} = \delta_{mM} - \frac{ik^2}{2}\mathop{\iint}_\mathcal{C}e^{-im{\theta'}}J_m(kr')\Delta\epsilon(\bo{r}')\psi^{(M)}(\bo{r}')d^2\bo{r}'.
	\end{equation}
In Appendix \ref{sec:app.basisEqn.greenFunction}, we lay out the method in more detail, 
discuss the numerical implementation and present a generalization for the complete 
vectorial electromagnetic fields.

\subsection{Examples}

\section{Smart Textile Antennae}
The last part of this essay recounts the author's contributions
in a project involving the design and theoretical characterization
of fibre-antennas. This section departs a little from the more theoretical
and numerical musings of the others and presents both the modeling of the 
antennae and their experimental characterization.   

The goal of the original project was to develop an antenna that is compatible with 
WiFi standards (i.e. emits at $f=2.45\,\unit{GHz}$) and easily integrated
to textile. These two requirements impose multiple restrictions on both
the materials that can be used and the geometry of the antenna. For seamless
integration, we would like the antenna to be spun directly into the textile. 

Most solutions today merely affix a patch antenna to a less 
encumbered part of the textile, e.g. on the should pads of a shirt
or the front of a t-shirt.
A metallic plate shields the user from the electronic components 
of the patch antenna. Because the properties of patch antennas are
well known, it requires very little engineering and is thus cheap. However, integration 
with the textile is far from seamless, as it is very apparent to the
user that he has become a giant walking antenna. Our project thus 
strives to find antenna designs that have emission properties
as flexible as a patch antenna's while improving textile integration
as to make it become transparent to the user.

The concept of a fibre-antenna rapidly established itself
as an ideal solution in the research group. It provides a rich
architecture upon which to build. Moreover, it can easily 
be spun into textile as it can loaded into the spools that 
deliver threads to looms. Its mechanical properties make it
fit for daily use as it can resist a trip in the washing machine. 
Integration of the electronic components inside that fibre 
serves to shield both the user and the components. 

\subsection{Basic Antenna Theory and HFSS Simulations}
Even today, a full 140 years after the publication of 
Maxwell's \textit{Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism}, 
the electromagnetic modeling of radiating structures 
is an ongoing research problem. The notorious difficulty 
of solving Maxwell's equations seriously hampers analytical efforts
and, due to the nature of electromagnetic radiation, numerical
progress is not easier to achieve.

In what follows, we present the basic equations of 
antenna theory (Maxwell's) and discuss the nature 
of sources in this framework (currents and charges). 

\subsubsection{Maxwell's Equations}
Being, by now, comfortable with the basic form of Maxwell's equations, 
we will simply state them for linear, non-chiral and reciprocal media
and allow for the existence of current and charge densities. 
They are (in Lorentz-Heaviside units with $c=1$) \cite{NOV2012}
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\times\bo{E}+\frac{\partial(\mu\bo{H})}{\partial t}	&=0	\\
   \nabla\times\bo{H}-\frac{\partial(\epsilon\bo{E})}{\partial t}-\bo{J}_c&=\bo{J}_s\\
   \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\bo{E})					&=\rho	\\
   \nabla\cdot(\mu\bo{H})					&=0
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where we have separated the current using two terms: a source current, $\bo{J}_s$ and
an induced conduction current $\bo{J}_c$. The induced conduction current
is related to the electric field via Ohm's law, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
   \bo{J}_c=\sigma\bo{E}
  \end{equation}
while the source current is a prepared, physical source initially 
independent of the system.

A technical point is in order. In the antenna literature, the induced
currents and charge density are considered as the fundamental quantities 
that \textit{produce} the fields. While worthwhile (see the Stratton-Chu section), 
this viewpoint requires that either (i) we have \textit{a priori} knowledge of 
the sources ($\bo{J}_t=\bo{J}_c+\bo{J}_s$ and $\rho$) or (ii) that we use the
constitutive relations down the line. The first case applies to situations
where the induced current is trivially known (e.g. the dipole antenna) or
when $\sigma=0$ and $\bo{J}_s$ is known.

Also, even though the $\bo{H}$ field was introduced as an auxiliary field to take
into account the effect of an applied magnetic field to the material, we 
take it as the fundamental field as it leads to more easily solvable
equations and is a completely equivalent choice. 

\subsubsection{Stratton-Chu Solution}
In antenna problems, we want to compute the field values as a function of 
the sources that contribute to these fields. From electrostatics, we know 
that a current density $\bo{J}$ gives rise to an electric field and a charge 
density $\rho$ gives rise to a magnetic field. In the time-varying picture, 
the electric and magnetic fields become coupled and we take the viewpoint that
the $\bo{J}$ and $\rho$ give rise to both electric and magnetic fields. 

To compute the field from these sources, which are presupposed to exist, 
we must use the Stratton-Chu integrals. The derivation is standard, so we 
refer to \cite{ELL2003}. Consider a volume $V$ of free space containing
sources and possibly excluded sub-volumes $V_i$ bound by surfaces $S_i$ that contain matter
of some kind. By the use of Green's and Stokes' theorems and other vectorial 
identities, we find that the field outside the excluded sub-volumes
can be expressed as
  \begin{align}
   \bo{E} &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\mathop{\iiint}_V \left(\rho\nabla G+i\omega G\bo{J}\right)dV
	+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oiint_{S_1,\cdots,S_N}\left[\bo{n}\cdot\bo{E}\nabla G+(\bo{n}\times\bo{E})\times\nabla G+i\omega G(\bo{n}\times\bo{H})\right]dS\label{eq:antenna.strattonChuE}\\
   \bo{H} &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\mathop{\iiint}_V \bo{J}\times\nabla G dV
	+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oiint_{S_1,\cdots,S_N}\left[-i\omega G(\bo{n}\times\bo{E})+(\bo{n}\times\bo{H})\times\nabla G+(\bo{n}\cdot\bo{H})\nabla G\right]dS\label{eq:antenna.strattonChuH}
  \end{align}
where $G$ is the Green's function of the problem
  \begin{equation}
   G(\bo{r},\bo{r}') = \frac{e^{ik|\bo{r}-\bo{r'}|}}{4\pi|\bo{r}-\bo{r}'|}.
  \end{equation}

These two equations are rigorous solutions of Maxwell's equations. 
They can be used with any antenna and provide ways to compute the 
current distribution if is unknown (constitutes an integral equation in the current)
and can be used to compute the far-field of antennae when either 
(i) the current distribution is known or (ii) the near-field around the antenna
is known. 
These two properties discriminate antennae into two categories, denoted Type I and Type II.

Type I antennae have a well-approximated current distribution, which means that there are no
sub-volumes to be excluded and therefore no surface integrals in expressions 
\eqref{eq:antenna.strattonChuE} and \eqref{eq:antenna.strattonChuH}. 

On the other hand, Type II antennae have well-approximated near-fields, leading
us to exclude the volume containing the antenna. Expressions \eqref{eq:antenna.strattonChuE}
and \eqref{eq:antenna.strattonChuH} contain only surface integrals, then. 

\subsubsection{Antenna Parameters}
In the design of our antenna, we will want to optimize the value
of some parameters. We will now describe some of these parameters.

\paragraph[Directivity and Gain]{Directivity and Gain \cite[\S 1.16]{ELL2003}}
Given a radiation pattern measured (in the far-field) as the power density 
$\mathcal{P}(\theta,\varphi)$, we can define its \textit{directivity}
as
  \begin{equation}
   D(\theta,\varphi) = \frac{4\pi\mathcal{P}(\theta,\varphi)}
			{\int_0^\pi\int_0^{2\pi}\mathcal{P}(\theta',\varphi')\sin\theta'd\theta'd\varphi'}.
  \end{equation}
The value of the directivity is less than unity if the power density radiated at angle $(\theta,\varphi)$
is less than the average power radiated. For instance, an isotropic antenna will possess a unit directivity
for all angles while a highly directional antenna will have a sharp peak  in its directivity function 
at some angle $(\theta,\varphi)$.

Another interesting concept to introduce is \textit{partial directivity}. 
The power density can be divided into two contributions: the $\theta$-polarized
and the $\varphi$-polarized polarization and we can write
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\theta,\varphi) = \mathcal{P}_\theta(\theta,\varphi)+\mathcal{P}_\varphi(\theta,\varphi)
  \end{equation}
where the subscripts indicate the polarization state. The partial 
directivities hence follow
  \begin{equation}
   D(\theta,\varphi) = D_\theta(\theta,\varphi)+D_\varphi(\theta,\varphi).
  \end{equation}

We can also introduce the gain, which characterizes the loss
and the directivity of the antenna simultaneously. It is simply given
as
  \begin{equation}
    G(\theta,\varphi) = \frac{4\pi r^2\mathcal{P}(\theta,\varphi)}{P}
  \end{equation}
where $P$ is the power accepted by the antenna. Because of the 
losses, 
	\begin{equation*}
		P/r^2>\int_0^\pi\int_0^{2\pi}\mathcal{P}(\theta',\varphi')\sin\theta'd\theta'd\varphi'
	\end{equation*}
such that $G(\theta,\varphi)<D(\theta,\varphi)$. 

We can also define partial gains in the exact same fashion we defined partial
directivities.

Radiation efficiency $\eta$ is defined as the ratio of the total radiated power 
to the power accepted by the antenna \cite{IEEE145-1993}.

\paragraph{Scattering Parameters}
The scattering parameters (or $S$-parameters) are
usually defined through a linear $N$-port network. 
Suppose we have an electronic device comprising
$N$ ports, or points of entry. Imagine shining light onto
one of the ports, say port $j$. A certain percentage
of the power carried by this light be reflected 
by this port and the rest will be transmitted to the
other ports or absorbed in the medium. The \textit{reflection}
coefficient is given by $S_{jj}$ while the transmission
coefficients are given $S_{ji}$ ($i\neq j$) where $\mat{S}$
is the scattering matrix of the network. In a reciprocal (in the sense
of Lorentz) network, the scattering matrix will be equal to its
transpose, i.e. $S_{ij}=S_{ji}$. In a lossless network, the scattering
matrix will be unitary. 

This is, of course, highly reminiscent of the scattering operator
in quantum-mechanical scattering which relates the outgoing (scattered)
components to the incoming (incident) components
  \begin{equation}
   \Ket{\Psi_\text{out}}=\mathcal{S}\Ket{\Psi_\text{in}}.
  \end{equation}
In this case, the ``ports'' are the different angular momenta
components rather than physical input/output connections. 
Ports are somewhat arbitrary in optical structures.

\subsection{HFSS Simulations of an LCX Antenna}
In our quest of finding a fibre-antenna design that can easily be integrated into
textile, we have stumbled upon the leaky coaxial cable (LCX) design: a basic coaxial cable
from which are cut windows as to expose the dielectric core. The radiation characteristics
can be tuned by changing the geometric properties of the windows. 

LCX antennae are usually analyzed using harmonic analysis \cite{WAN2001}. 
In our case, however, we cannot consider the structure to be periodic, as the total 
length of the fibre-antenna is of the order of the wavelength ($\lambda\sim12\unit{cm}$) and the period
of the slots is smaller than the wavelength. Moreover, given the size of the slots, 
the author is comfortable to say that we neither are in the perturbation regime. 
Figure \ref{fig:antenna.fibre-antenna} shows the actual design and the important parameters.

Given the wild scale in the size of the structures (from the nanometer to the millimeter), we use
the FEM to solve the driven problem. The parameters of interest will be the scattering parameters, the
radiation pattern and antenna efficiency, gain and directivity. We will first model the fibre-antennae
that were fabricated. There will be a subsequent optimization phase.

\subsection{Leaky Coaxial Cable}
The first design we have looked into is a well known one:
the \textit{leaky coaxial fibre} (LCXF). It simply consists of
a coaxial cable (metal rod, dielectric layer, metal coating)
from which we have removed some of the metallic coating. 
These holes in the metallic coating are called ``windows'' and
allow light to escape the confines of the coax cable, hence
the moniker \textit{leaky}. In the following section, we will
look at several methods that we used to model the device
and present the design parameters that were used. 

\subsubsection{Specifications of the Devices}
An image is worth a thousand words. Figure \ref{fig:antenna.fibre-antenna.xsection}
shows a cross-section of the fibre. Figure \ref{fig:antenna.fibre-antenna.topview} 
shows a top view of the antenna and display the positions of the windows. 
Multiple designs have been fabricated, but we retain only those that 
we have tried to simulate. Table \ref{tab:antenna.rfxx-parameters} 
shows the actual geometrical parameters of the fibre-antennas.

\paragraph*{On the thickness of the silver shells}
The thicknesses of the dielectric materials are provided by the manufacturer, 
Polymicro Technologies, safe for the thicknesses of the silver layers. 
For the time being, we have calculated those thicknesses by measuring
the DC resistance of the inner and outer layers of silver and
using the relation \cite[p.~204]{CHE1989}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:antenna.dcResistivity}
    R = \frac{L}{\sigma A}
  \end{equation}
where $L$ is the length of the fibre, $\sigma$ the conductivity of the silver
layer and $A$ its area. For the inner and outer layers, we have
  \begin{align}
    A_\text{inner}	&= \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{t_\text{vac}}^{t_\text{vac}+t_\text{Ag1}}r\,dr d\theta= \pi\left(2t_\text{vac}t_\text{Ag1}+t_\text{Ag1}^2\right)	\\
    A_\text{outer}	&= \int_0^{2\pi}\int_T^{T+t_\text{Ag2}}r\,dr d\theta = \pi\left(2Tt_\text{Ag2}+t_\text{Ag2}^2\right)
  \end{align}
where $T=t_\text{vac}+t_\text{Ag1}+t_\text{Si}+t_\text{pyamide}$. 
Substituting these results into \eqref{eq:antenna.dcResistivity}
yields
  \begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:antenna:thickGeneralEquations}
  \begin{align}  
   t_\text{Ag1}^2 + 2t_\text{vac}t_\text{Ag1}-\frac{L}{\sigma_\text{Ag0}\pi R_\text{inner}}	&=0	\\
   t_\text{Ag2}^2 + 2Tt_\text{Ag2}-\frac{L}{\sigma_\text{Ag0}\pi R_\text{outer}}			&=0
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where the $R$s are the measured D.C. resistances measured for each shell. 
This can readily be solved using the quadratic equation. Using the bulk conductivity
of silver (see Table \ref{tab:antenna.physicalParameters}) yields the 
thicknesses found in Table \ref{tab:antenna.rfxx-parameters}.

\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}
We first model the RF21 design. Its parameters are summarized in 
Table \ref{tab:antenna.rfxx-parameters}. 

Notice the small thickness
of the silver layers (126 and 101 nm) compared to the other 
sizes involved. It takes a highly non-uniform mesh to model
these small relative sizes. Moreover, since the silver has a high
conductivity, it takes an even smaller mesh to model. Our first 
attempts at modeling this structure proved unsuccessful.

In the experimental data (\see Figure \ref{fig:antenna.sParameters}), 
we see deep dips in the transmission spectrum ($S_{12}$) at approximately
1.8 GHz and 3 GHz. There are corresponding dips in the reflection parameters,
$S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$, which leads us to believe that remaining power 
was radiated through the slots. The existence of two dips seems predicated on the asymmetry
of the fibre ($d_L\neq d_R$). 

We also notice that the simulation data does not in any way correlate
to the experimental data. This is probably due to the fact that, in the our
HFSS model, we had to put the thickness of the silvers layers to $2\,\unit{\mu m}$
instead of the values listed in Table \ref{tab:antenna.rfxx-parameters}. In 
this regime, the fibre-antenna behaves like an ordinary transmission line. 
However, as the mesher does not allow us to go under $2\,\unit{\mu m}$, we cannot
conclude that is really due to the thickness of the Ag layers, only suspect it.

In our following report, we will break down the problem
to make it analytically tractable and try to analyze the effect of ``small''
silver layers on the propagation of light.

\section{Antenna Modelization}

In our previous simulations, it was clear that something was amiss:
there was no correlation between the simulation and
experimental data. AFM pictures (see Figure \ref{fig:antenna.AFM})  have suggested that the deposited
metal is in fact a mixture of silver and silver oxide. To evaluate
the effective conductivity of the mixture, we have used Bruggeman's model \cite{LAN1978}.
The model starts from a homogeneous medium, call it medium 1, 
of conductivity $\sigma_1$ and replaces spherical portions of this material 
by another one of conductivity $\sigma_2$. When this process is done, 
we are left with a inhomogeneous material with partial concentrations $\delta_i$
of each material. The effective conductivity $\sigma_e$ of the medium can be computed
using the relation (for an arbitrary number of materials)
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_i^n \delta_i \frac{\sigma_i-\sigma_e}{\sigma_i+(d-1)\sigma_e} =0 
  \end{equation}
where $\sum_i\delta_i=1$ and $d$ is the dimensionality of the system.
Solving for $\sigma_e$ in the case $n=2$ yields
  \begin{equation}
   (d-1)\sigma_e^2+\left[\left(d\delta_1-1\right)\sigma_1+\left(d\delta_2-1\right)\sigma_2\right]+\sigma_1\sigma_2=0.
  \end{equation}
The positive solution is, defining $q=\left(d\delta_1-1\right)\sigma_1+\left(d\delta_2-1\right)\sigma_2$
  \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:antenna:bruggeman}
   \sigma_e = \frac{1}{2d-2}\left[q+\sqrt{q^2+4(d-1)\sigma_1\sigma_2}\right].
  \end{equation}

	  silver layer. \textbf{(b)} Sample image showing the inhomogeneity of the
	  silver layer.}
 \label{fig:antenna.AFM}
\end{figure}


\paragraph*{Size Effects}
It has recently come to our attention that the conductivity 
of thin metal films can be a function of their thicknesses. 
We will explore this in future work, so for now 
suffice it to say that the Fuchs-Sondheimer model states
that
  \begin{equation}
      \sigma_F = \frac{\sigma_0}{1+\frac{3\lambda}{8d}\left(1-p\right)}
  \end{equation}
where $0\leq p\leq1$ is a specularity parameter and $\lambda$ is the 
electron free mean path in the metal. This model states that conductivity
diminishes as the thickness of the metallic layer gets smaller.


In Figure \ref{fig:antenna.thicknessRatios}, we compare the 
thicknesses obtained via the bulk conductivity model (Bruggeman 
effective conductivity) and the Fuchs-Sondheimer model with 
effective conductivity for the RF33 fibre. Given that the AFM pictures
show surface inhomogeneity, we assume diffuse scattering in 
the FS model ($p=0$). We see that choosing a dimensionality 
of 3 or 2 does not significantly affect the thicknesses, but
we see a difference of about 20\% in the effective conductivities.

The most interesting thing, though, is that the FS
model predicts metallic layers that are 10\% to 80\% thicker 
than with the bulk conductivity model. This will be explored 
in the next report.

\subsubsection{Finite Element Method}
As finite element methods directly solve Maxwell's equations, 
they can be a useful tool to verify semi-analytical methods. 
In the last report, we reported some agreement issues 
between experimental and simulation data. We purported
that the discrepancy was due to the small size of the
silver layers that we could properly account for in 
the finite element model. This issue has been solved
by abandoning the idea of properly meshing the silver layers
and replacing them by appropriate impedance boundary conditions.
From HFSS's documentation, we see that the ``Layered Impedance 
Boundary Conditions'' module follows the theory set forth in 
\cite{MIT1968} and others. 

We have simulated the RF21 fibre using Bruggeman's model
for the effective conductivity and with values
of $\delta_1\in\{0,1\}$ and $d=3$ in \eqref{eq:antenna:bruggeman}.
After obtaining the simulated $S_\text{11}$ parameter of the fibre,
we compared it to the experimentally obtained one using the Pearson
correlation coefficient. For two samples $\{X_i\}$ and 
$\{Y_i\}$, it is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    r = \frac{\sum_i^n\left(X_i-\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)\left(Y_i-\left\langle Y\right\rangle\right)}
	     {\sqrt{\sum_i^n\left(X_i-\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)^2}\sqrt{\sum_i^n\left(Y_i-\left\langle Y\right\rangle\right)^2}}.
  \end{equation}
From the definition, we see that the simultaneous linear transformations $X_i\rightarrow b+aX_i$ and $Y_i\rightarrow d+cY_1$
do not change the value of the Pearson coefficient. This means that even if the two samples
do not have the same normalization or are shifted by a constant amount, the correlation 
will stay the same. As such, the Pearson correlation measures the delegend(loc=1, prop={'size':6})
gree at which 
both samples are linearly related. 

Figure \ref{fig:antenna.sParameters} shows the experimental and simulated
$S_{11}$ parameter. At first look, it might seem like the general form 
of the curves are similar, but our quantitative analysis will show 
that that would be wrong. To make sure that our simulation data was not simply
shifted in frequency due to an small error in the geometry, we have
also calculated the correlation for a shifted dataset 
\footnote{To do so, we simply right-shifted the arrays containing
the simulation data and removed the data that fell outside the frequency range 
of the experimental data.}. This changes
the Pearson correlation because we must elide some of the experimental
and simulation data to do so. Figure \ref{fig:antenna.shiftCorrelation}
shows our results. We see that there are little to no correlation
between the simulation data and the experimental data with $r\in\{-0.04,0.05\}$. 

A possible source of error is the thickness of the silver layers. We will incorporate
the FS model in the next simulations and determine if it is
a factor.

\end{figure}

We have also taken the Fourier transform of the experimental
and simulation data (for $\delta_1=0$). To our discontent, 
it seems that the datasets do not share periodic properties. 
Figure \ref{fig:antenna.fourierAnalysis} shows the intensity
of the FFT transform. To see if the periodic components corresponded
to particular lengths in the system, we converted the associated
wavelenghts to frequencies and plotted them as vertical lines in the figure. 
$f_1$ is the fundamental mode of infinite LCXF, namely
  \begin{equation}
   f_1 = \frac{c}{\left(S_z+d_z\right)\left(\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{Si}}+1\right)}.
  \end{equation}
The frequency associated with the optical and the actual lengths of the window
are
  \begin{align*}
   l_\text{opt}	&= \frac{c}{S_z\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{Si}}}	\\
   l_\text{phy}	&= \frac{c}{S_z}.
  \end{align*}

Nothing thus far seems to explain the periodic properties of the 
$S_{11}$ parameter of the experimental and simulation, although
the optical length of the windows seems to explain a single 
peak in the Fourier power spectrum. 

The author is not sure that is the proper method to
analyze the Fourier spectrum, however.
