In recent years, outbursts in technology have changed the way 
we view, and do, science. In the days of yore, when the rose
that is physics had not yet been given its name, science
was in major part an experimental endeavour. It took the great
Werner Heisenberg to establish theoretical physics as its own field. 

In this thesis, we seek to reverse the recent trend that purports
that data is self-sufficient, that the throne of theory has been 
usurped by the opulent and almight data. 

We will first investigate the modelization of bidimensional dielectric
cavities. The last decade has shown that this type of micron-sized device
is ripe with applications ranging from biodetection to lasing action (more on that
later). This has motivated the scientific community to investigate the behaviour
of such cavities mostly as a function of their geometry. We will generalize
