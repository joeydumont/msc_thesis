\chapter{Passive Media}
This chapter is devoted to the study of light propagation in 
dielectric bidimensional cavities. Starting from Maxwell's equations, 
we derive approximate differential equations that govern 
the wave behaviour in cavities having spatially-varying 
refractive index profiles (henceforth referred to as 
\textit{inhomogeneous cavities}). This set of reduced equations
serves as the basis for a semi-analytical solution method 
that uses the quantum machinery of the \gls{sMatrix}
and its associated \gls{qMatrix} to yield information
about the cavity modes. The numerical implementation of the
method is discussed and and is then demonstrated for a selected
set of microcavities. 

\section{Maxwell's Equations for Bidimensional Cavities: Reduction from 3D to 2D}
\subsection{Setting the Stage}
As with any problem in optics, we start from Maxwell's equations. Although 
this specific chapter focuses on dielectric cavities, we will show Maxwell's equations
in their full generality, as we will later study problems with currents and sources. 
We use the Lorentz-Heaviside set of units with the speed of light, $c$, equal to 1. 
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\times\bo{E}(\bo{r},t)+\frac{\partial\bo{B}(\bo{r},t)}{\partial t}	&=0			\\
   \nabla\times\bo{H}(\bo{r},t)-\frac{\partial\bo{D}(\bo{r},t)}{\partial t}	&=\bo{j}_s(\bo{r},t)+\bo{j}_c(\bo{r},t)	\\
   \nabla\cdot\bo{D}(\bo{r},t)							&=\rho(\bo{r},t)			\\
   \nabla\cdot\bo{B}(\bo{r},t)							&=0
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where $\bo{E}$ is the electric field, $\bo{D}$ the electric displacement, $\bo{H}$
the magnetic field, $\bo{B}$ the magnetic induction and where 
$\bo{j}$ and $\rho$ are the current and charge densities, respectively. 
The distinction between a source current, $\bo{j}_s$ and an induced conduction
current, $\bo{j}_c$, is arbitrary but will prove conceptually useful when dealing
with radiating structures (see next chapter).
In this thesis, we will generally take $\rho=0$ and $\bo{j}_s=\bo{0}$
as there will be no physical charges/currents in our problems.

This very general set of equations does not make any assumption on the 
properties of the medium in which the fields exist: it is, therefore, 
almost impossible to solve. To properly model the effect of different media,
we introduce the usual constitutive relations:
\index{constitutive relations|(}
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \bo{D}(\bo{r},t)	&= \bo{E}(\bo{r},t)+\bo{P}(\bo{r},t)	\\
    \bo{B}(\bo{r},t)	&= \bo{H}(\bo{r},t)+\bo{M}(\bo{r},t)	
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where the effects of the medium are accounted for in $\bo{P}$
and $\bo{M}$, the polarization and magnetization fields, respectively.
In the time domain, the effect of the electric (magnetic) field on the polarization
(magnetization) can be written as
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \bo{P}	&= \iiiint \bo{\chi}_e(\bo{r}, \bo{r}',t, t'; \bo{E})\cdot\bo{E}(\bo{r}', t') d^3\bo{r}'dt' + \bo{P}^{NL}	\\
   \bo{j}_c	&= \iiiint \bo{\sigma}_e(\bo{r}, \bo{r}',t, t';\bo{E})\cdot\bo{E}(\bo{r}', t') d^3\bo{r}'dt'+ \bo{j}_c^{NL}			\\
   \bo{M}	&= \iiiint \bo{\chi}_m(\bo{r}, \bo{r}',t, t'; \bo{H})\cdot\bo{H}(\bo{r}', t') d^3\bo{r}'dt' + \bo{M}^{NL}
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where $\bo{\chi}_{e,m}$ are the electric and magnetic tensorial susceptibilities and 
$\bo{\sigma}_e$ the tensorial electric conductivity. They 
are written here as (possibly non-linear) response functions. We will 
take the nonlinear magnetization and induced current, 
$\bo{M}^{NL}$ and $\bo{j}_c^{NL}$, to be identically zero. 
While $\bo{P}^{NL}$ is usually reserved for the nonlinear polarization, 
we will use it to denote the effect of a gain medium, whether it is 
nonlinear or not. 

While it is possible to compute these quantities from first principles 
using statistical mechanics techniques, this is a highly complicated topic
that we will not delve into. We will consider local, causal and isotropic (although possibly
spatially varying) responses. The tensorial response functions become scalar and their spatial
dependence is given by a three dimensional 
Dirac $\delta$-function. This allows
us to write the constitutive relations in the much simpler form
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \bo{P}	&= \int_0^\infty \chi_e(\bo{r}, t')\bo{E}(\bo{r}, t-t')dt' + \bo{P}^{NL}	\\
   \bo{j}_c	&= \int_0^\infty \sigma_e(\bo{r}, t')\bo{E}(\bo{r}, t-t')dt'			\\
   \bo{M}	&= \int_0^\infty \chi_m(\bo{r}, t')\bo{H}(\bo{r}, t-t')dt'
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
\index{constitutive relations|)}
Substituting these results into the Maxwell equations and 
and using the Fourier transform yields the set
\footnote{Notice that, in our system of units, $\omega=k$ and thus
we will make use of frequency and wavenumber interchangeably.
We will also suppress all explicit frequency dependence
from our notation, as it rapidly becomes cumbersome.}
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \label{eq:passive.formalism.generalCurlEquations}
   \nabla\times\bo{E}(\bo{r},\omega)-i\omega\mu(\bo{r},\omega)\bo{H}(\bo{r},\omega)		&=0 	\\
   \nabla\times\bo{H}(\bo{r},\omega)+i\omega\epsilon(\bo{r},\omega)\bo{E}(\bo{r},\omega)	&=-i\omega\bo{P}^{NL}(\bo{r},\omega)
  \end{align}
where $\mu=1+\chi_m$ is the permeability and $\epsilon=1+\chi_e-\sigma/i\omega$
the permittivity.
In the remainder of this thesis, we will concerned by the solution
of this precise set of equations. We also recall the
\textit{electromagnetic boundary conditions}
\index{boundary conditions!electromagnetic}
associated with 
a discontinuous jump in the permeability or permittivity
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:passive.formalism.generalBoundaryConditions}
    \hat{\bo{n}}\cdot\left(\bo{B}_2-\bo{B}_1\right)	&= 0,		&	\hat{\bo{n}}\times\left(\bo{E}_2-\bo{E}_1\right)	&=0,	\\
    \hat{\bo{n}}\times\left(\bo{H}_2-\bo{H}_1\right)	&=\bo{K},	&	\hat{\bo{n}}\cdot\left(\bo{D}_2-\bo{D}_1\right)&=\Sigma.
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

\subsection{Dimension Reduction}
In this section we derive the differential equations 
for the electromagnetic field in an infinitely long
dielectric cylinder of arbitrary cross-section and arbitrary
physical parameters $\epsilon$ and $\mu$. There is no gain medium.
Consequently, $\bo{P}^{NL}=\bo{K}=\Sigma\equiv0$ in our previous equations.
We also require translational symmetry, i.e. that there exist no parametric dependence
on $z$.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{passive/dimensionReduction.pdf}
 \caption[Schematic view of the reduction of Maxwell's equations from 3D to 2D]
	 {Our set of equations will be valid for infinitely long cylinders of
	  arbitrary cross-sections (shown on the left) and arbitrary physical parameters
	  $\epsilon$ and $\mu$. Our cavities, however, are bidimensional (shown on the right). 
	  The dimension reduction thus consists in postulating independence of the fields
	  and physical and geometrical parameters of the cavity with regards to the longitudinal coordinate 
	  and choosing a particular plane $\partial\Omega$.}
\end{figure}

To this effect, it will be useful to separate the field 
in tranverse and longitudinal components. Following \cite{JAC1962,SCH2004}, 
we suppose the fields can be written as 
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{Bmatrix}\bo{E}(\bo{r}_\perp,z)\\\bo{H}(\bo{r}_\perp,z)\end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix}\bo{E}(\bo{r}_\perp)\\\bo{H}(\bo{r}_\perp)\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\beta z}
  \end{equation}
and we will also separate the fields and differential operators in two parts
  \begin{equation}
   \bo{E}(\bo{r}_\perp)= \bo{E}_\perp+E_z\bou{z}; \qquad \nabla=\nabla_\perp + \bou{z}\frac{d}{dz}.
  \end{equation}
Substitution in \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.generalCurlEquations} yields
  \begin{align}
    ik\mu H_z 		&= \left(\nabla_\perp\times\bo{E}_\perp\right)_z			& -ik\epsilon E_z 		&= \left(\nabla_\perp\times \bo{H}_\perp\right)_z	\label{eq:passive.formalism.longitudinalComponents}\\
    ik\mu\bo{H_\perp}	&= \left(-i\beta\bo{E}_\perp+\nabla_\perp E_z\right)\times\bou{z}	& -ik\epsilon\bo{E}_\perp 	&= \left(-i\beta\bo{H}_\perp+\nabla_\perp H_z\right)\times\bou{z} \label{eq:passive.formalism.tranverseComponents}
  \end{align}
The symmetry of these equations allow the decoupling of the tranverse and longitudinal components. 
Solving the system \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.tranverseComponents} 
shows that the scalar components $H_z$ and $E_z$ are the fundamental ones:
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \bo{E}_\perp	&= \frac{i}{k^2n^2-\beta^2}\left[\beta\nabla_\perp E_z+k\mu\nabla_\perp H_z\times\bou{z}\right]	\\
    \bo{H}_\perp	&= \frac{i}{k^2n^2-\beta^2}\left[-k\epsilon\nabla_\perp E_z\times\bou{z}+\beta\nabla_\perp H_z\right].
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
Derivation of the differential equation for $E_z$ and $H_z$ can be
done via equations \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.longitudinalComponents}, but
is quite cumbersome. A component-wise approach is thus presented in Appendix \ref{app:basicEquations}. 

More specific boundary conditions can be derived with the use of these equations.
Applying the tranverse and longitudinal decomposition on \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.generalBoundaryConditions}
yields the six boundary conditions
  \begin{align*}
   E_{z1}		&= E_{z2}		& H_{z1}	&= H_{z2}	\label{eq:passive.formalism.contLongComponents}\\
   E_{t1}		&= E_{t2}		& H_{t1}	&= H_{t2}	\\
   \epsilon_1E_{n1}	&= \epsilon_2E_{n2}	& \mu_1H_{n1}	&= \mu_2H_{n2}
  \end{align*}
We seek to write the boundary conditions as a function of $H_z$ and $E_z$,
given that they are the fundamental fields. This can be done by taking
the projections of the tranverse fields:
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   E_t	&= \bou{t}\cdot\bo{E}_\perp = \frac{i}{\gamma^2}\left[\beta\partial_tE_z-k\mu\partial_nH_z\right]	\\
   E_n	&= \bou{n}\cdot\bo{E}_\perp = \frac{i}{\gamma^2}\left[\beta\partial_nE_z+k\mu\partial_tH_z\right]	\\
   H_t	&= \bou{t}\cdot\bo{H}_\perp = \frac{i}{\gamma^2}\left[k\epsilon\partial_nE_z+\beta\partial_tH_z\right]	\\
   H_n	&= \bou{n}\cdot\bo{H}_\perp = \frac{i}{\gamma^2}\left[-k\epsilon\partial_tE_z+\beta\partial_nH_z\right]	
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where $\partial_{t,n}$ are the tranverse and normal derivatives, respectively, and $\gamma^2=k^2n^2-\beta^2$.
Substituting these results in the boundary conditions for the tranverse and normal components, we can 
derive the conditions $\partial_tE_{z1}=\partial_tE_{z2}$, $\partial_tH_{z1}=\partial_tH_{z2}$, which can 
shown to be equivalent to the continuity of the longitudinal components, 
\textit{viz.} \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.contLongComponents} \cite{SCH2004}.
Combining all our previous results yields the four independent 
boundary conditions:
  \begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:passive.formalism.cylindricalBoundaryConditions}
  \begin{align}
   E_{z1}	&= E_{z2}	\\
   H_{z1}	&= H_{z2}	\\
   \frac{k\mu_1}{\gamma_1^2}\frac{\partial H_{z1}}{\partial n}-\frac{k\mu_2}{\gamma_2^2}\frac{\partial H_{z2}}{\partial n} & = \beta\left(\frac{1}{\gamma_1^2}-\frac{1}{\gamma_2^2}\right)\frac{\partial E_{z1}}{\partial t}\\
   \frac{k\epsilon_1}{\gamma_1^2}\frac{\partial E_{z1}}{\partial n}-\frac{k\epsilon_2}{\gamma_2^2}\frac{\partial E_{z2}}{\partial n} & = -\beta\left(\frac{1}{\gamma_1^2}-\frac{1}{\gamma_2^2}\right)\frac{\partial H_{z1}}{\partial t}.
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
Notice that the propagation constant couples the electric 
and magnetic field, regardless of the physical and geometrical
parameters of the cavity. 

\section{Scattering Matrix Formalism}
The previous section has provided us with the differential equations that 
we will need to solve to properly model bidimensional cavities. In this section, 
we will set up a scattering matrix ($\mat{S}$-matrix) formalism, augmented by the \textit{\gls{qMatrix}}
that will allow us to quantify the response of the cavities
to an applied field and provide us with a novel way to determine their resonances. 
The numerical implementation of the method, being somewhat problematic, will 
be discussed at length. 

\subsection{$\mat{S}$ and $\mat{Q}$ Matrices Reloaded}
In dielectic cavities, we need to solve the following equations
  \begin{multline}
    \left\{\nabla^2+k^2n^2\left[1-\left(\frac{\beta}{kn}\right)^2\right]\right\}\begin{Bmatrix} H_z \\ E_z \end{Bmatrix}
      = \frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{\beta}{kn}\right)^2}
	  \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon}\begin{Bmatrix} \nabla H_z \\ \nabla E_z \end{Bmatrix}\cdot\nabla\epsilon+\frac{1}{\mu}\begin{Bmatrix} \nabla  H_z \\ \nabla E_z \end{Bmatrix}\cdot\nabla\mu\right]
      \\-\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\mu} & 0 \\ 0 &\frac{1}{\epsilon}\end{pmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \nabla H_z \cdot\nabla\mu \\ \nabla E_z\cdot\nabla\epsilon \end{Bmatrix}
      +\frac{\beta/kn}{1-\left(\frac{\beta}{kn}\right)^2}\left[\left(\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}+\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}}\right)\begin{pmatrix}0 & -\frac{1}{\mu}\\\frac{1}{\epsilon} & 0\end{pmatrix}
      \begin{Bmatrix} \nabla H_z\times\nabla\mu \\ \nabla E_z\times\nabla\epsilon\end{Bmatrix}\right]
  \end{multline}
where $\beta$ is the propagation constant in the longitudinal direction.
Inhomogeneous cavities do not obey Helmholtz's equation like homogeneous
cavities do, but depend upon the first-order derivatives of the fields and 
physical properties of the medium. The two longitudinal fields
couple through the last term, where an antidiagonal matrix appears.

%Modes with finite $\beta$ correspond, in the semiclassical limit, to
%rays that spiral up and down the cavity and refract out through 
%the caps \cite{TUR2005}. The cavity modes, the ones we are interested in, 
%are best modeled using $\beta=0$. 

In fact, this set of equations describe the propagation of light 
in optical fibers of arbitrary cross-section and arbitrary
refractive index profiles. However, we are interested in the modes
that are confined on a two-dimensional surface, the cavity modes. 
These modes must be independent of $z$ and we therefore take 
$\beta=0$. This is the main approximation of our model. It has been shown
to hold only approximately in experimental conditions \cite{DUB2008,BIT2010}, 
but we take the resulting equations to be the exact one. This allow a 
simpler analysis for qualitative exploration; quantitative agreement
could be reached via perturbation methods. This approximation 
has the much appreciated benefit of decoupling both the field
equations and the boundary conditions (see \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.cylindricalBoundaryConditions}).

Additionnally exploiting the fact that we will only consider
non-magnetic media ($\mu=1$, $\epsilon=n^2$), our equation set becomes
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2\right] H_z	&= \frac{2}{n}\nabla H_z\cdot\nabla n	\label{eq:passive.formalism.TEequation}\\
    \left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2\right] E_z	&= 0. 
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
In the following, it will be advantageous to form the field
$\bo{h}=\bo{H}/n$ \cite{DET2009}. This yields the equation
\cite{DET2009, GAP2013}
  \begin{equation}
   \left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2-\frac{2\left(\nabla n\right)^2}{n^2}+\frac{\left(\nabla^2n\right)}{n}\right]h_z=0 \tag{\ref{eq:passive.formalism.TEequation}'}
   \label{eq:passive.formalism.TEequationPrime}
  \end{equation}
which is nothing but Helmholtz equation with an additional potential term.

\begin{figure}

 \caption[Geometry of a bidimensional cavity]
	 {Geometry of a dimensional cavity. $R_0$ is the radius of the smallest circle
	 that encloses the physical microcavity. $R_V$ is the radius of a fictional circle
	 that we will take to go to infinity.}
\end{figure}


To solve these equations, we will adopt a scattering viewpoint. 
Imagine that the dielectric cavity is embedded in an infinite
medium of constant refractive index  $n_o=\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}$, 
outside the cavity, $\bo{r}\not\in{\mathcal{C}}$, 
the r.h.s. of our set vanishes. The resulting equations 
are Helmholtz's and therefore have the well-known solution
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:passive.formalism.hankelSolution}
    \psi = \sum_{m} \left[A_m H_m^{(-)}(nkr) + B_m H_m^{(+)}(nkr)\right]e^{im\theta} \qquad (r>R_0).
  \end{equation}
where $H_m^{(\pm)}(z)$ are the Hankel functions of the first
and second kind. The Hankel functions are chosen in lieu of their
usual homologues $J_m(z)$ and $Y_m(z)$ as their asymptotic forms 
have incoming/outgoing cylindrical wave character, 
$H_m^{(\pm)}\propto \exp(\pm ikr)/\sqrt{r}$. The scattering
viewpoint essentially describes the relationship between the 
outgoing coefficients, $B_m$, and the incoming coefficients, $A_m$
via the \textit{scattering matrix}
  \begin{equation}
    B_m = S_{mm'}A_{m'}. 
  \end{equation}
Much like its quantum-mechanical counterpart, the scattering
matrix can be interpreted as a phase shift acquired by the incoming
waves through interaction with the potential. This is most easily seen
by considering a central potential $V(r)$ where the \gls{sMatrix}
is diagonal. In that case, the $m$ component of the field can
be written as
  \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:passive.formalism.centralPotentialField}
   \psi_m \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\left[e^{-ikr}+e^{i\delta_m}e^{ikr}\right]
  \end{equation}
where we have written $S_{mm}=e^{i\delta_m}$ with $\delta_m\in\mathbb{R}$ 
as per the unitarity condition. The non-diagonal
generalization $S_{mm'}$ describes the coupling between angular
momenta $m\rightarrow m'$ and can be interpreted as a transition
probability. 
It should be noted that the \gls{sMatrix} contains all near- and
far-field information. 

In most applications (see the Introduction), we wish to find the \textit{resonances} of the
cavity. This is usually done by enforcing Sommerfeld radiation conditions
on Helmholtz's equation and looking for solutions of
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{S}^{-1}\bo{B}=0;
  \end{equation}
i.e. an infinitesimal input provides an infinite output. 
A solution exists only if $|\det{\mat{S}(k)}|\rightarrow\infty$, 
at a pole of the \gls{sMatrix}. 
For real potentials, there cannot exist a solution on the real $k$ line because
of the flux conservation (unitarity) property of the \gls{sMatrix}. We 
must extend the search to the complex $k$ plane.

\todo[inline]{Non-renormalizable QB states.}
\todo[inline]{Complex potentials -> trajectory of poles in $k$ plane to real line. Freddy
	      foreshadowing for next part.}

We will proceed a different way. It is possible to find the signatures
of these poles on the real $k$ line by computing the \textit{energy}
of the modes and their complex coupling. This part of the formalism
was initally developed by G.P.-A. \cite{GAP2013}: we will repeat
only what is necessary. 

Recall that the average electromagnetic energy of a field
in a given volume $V$
  \begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}^V = \frac{1}{2}\mathop{\iiint}_V\left[\epsilon\bo{E}^*\cdot\bo{E}+\mu\bo{H}^*\cdot\bo{H}\right]d^3\bo{r}.
  \end{equation}
We form the energy matrix 
  \begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}^V_{mm'} = \frac{1}{2}\mathop{\iiint}_V\left[\epsilon\bo{E}^*_m\cdot\bo{E}_{m'}+\mu\bo{H}^*_m\cdot\bo{H}_{m'}\right]d^3\bo{r}.
  \end{equation}
We will carry out the rest of the computation for the TM mode ($H_z=E_r=E_\theta=0$);
the argument holds for TE polariation \textit{mutatis mutandis} because of the
$k$-independence of the additional potential term in \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.TEequationPrime}
and also because $\bo{h}\propto\bo{H}$ for $r>R_0$. We thus have 
  \begin{align*}
    \bo{E}	&= \psi\bou{z}	\\
    \bo{H}	&= \frac{1}{ik}\nabla\times\bo{E}
  \end{align*}
and the energy matrix becomes
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{E}^V_{mm'}	&= \frac{1}{2}\mathop{\iiint}_V\left[\epsilon\psi^*_{m}\psi_{m'}+\frac{1}{k^2}\left(\nabla\times\psi_{m}\bo{\hat{z}}\right)\cdot\left(\nabla\times\psi^*_{m'}\bo{\hat{z}}\right)\right]d^3\bo{r}.	\nonumber\\
  \end{align}
Taking the parametric derivative of Helmholtz' equation, we get the 
following relations
  \begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:passive.formalism.parametricHelmholtz}
  \begin{align}
   \left[\nabla^2+n^2k^2\right]\psi								&=0	\\
   \left[\nabla^2+n^2k^2\right]\psi^*								&=0	\\
   \nabla^2\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}+2kn^2\psi+n^2k^2\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}	&=0
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where we assume a real potential.
Forming the product
  \begin{align*}
   \frac{1}{2k}\nabla\cdot\left[\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\nabla\psi^*-\psi^*\nabla\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\right]
	&= \frac{1}{2k}\left[\nabla\psi^*\cdot\nabla\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}+\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\nabla^2\psi^*
			  -\nabla\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\cdot\nabla\psi^*-\psi^*\nabla^2\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\right]	\\
	&= \frac{1}{2k}\left[n^2\psi^*\left(2k\psi+k^2\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}\right)-\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial k}n^2k^2\psi^*\right]\\
	&= n^2\psi^*\psi
  \end{align*}
where we have used the identity \cite[Appendix II]{STR41}
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot\left(\phi\bo{A}\right) = \bo{A}\cdot\nabla\phi+\phi\nabla\cdot\bo{A}.
  \end{equation}
We will also use the
identity
  \begin{equation}
    (\bo{a}\times\bo{b})\cdot(\bo{c}\times\bo{d}) = \bo{a}\cdot\left[\bo{b}\times(\bo{c}\times\bo{d})\right]
  \end{equation}
to write the energy matrix as
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{E}^V_{mm'} &= \frac{1}{4k}\int_V\nabla\cdot
			    \left\{
			      \frac{\partial\psi_{m'}}{\partial k}\nabla\psi^*_{m}-\psi^*_m\nabla\frac{\partial\psi_{m'}}{\partial k}
			+   \frac{2}{k}\left[\psi_{m'}\bo{\hat{z}}\times\nabla\times\psi^*_m\bo{\hat{z}}\right]\right\}d^3\bo{r}
  \end{align}
Using the divergence theorem, noting that the normal vector
is the radial vector, we obtain
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{E}^V_{mm'}	&= \frac{wR_V}{4k}
			  \int_0^{2\pi}\left(\frac{\partial\psi_{m'}}{\partial k}\frac{\partial\psi^*_m}{\partial r}
					      -\psi^*_m\frac{\partial^2\psi_{m'}}{\partial k\partial r}\right)d\theta	\nonumber
			+\frac{wR_V}{2k}
			  \int_0^{2\pi}\psi_{m'}\frac{\partial\psi^*_m}{\partial r} d\theta
  \end{align}
Using the exterior solution for $\psi_m$ and using the 
asymptotic expressions \eqref{eq:app.Bessel.asymptoticHankel} for the Hankel functions, we get
(after some algebra)
  \begin{align}
   \mathcal{E}^{\infty}_{mm'} &= \lim_{R_V\rightarrow\infty}\left[\frac{4n_0wR_V}{k}+\mathcal{O}(R_V^{-1})\right]\delta_{mm'}
			      + \frac{4w}{k}\left(-i\sum_\ell S^*_{\ell m}\frac{\partial S_{\ell m'}}{\partial k}\right)
  \end{align}
where $w$ is the thickness of the cavity. The first term is the 
diverging energy of the beam. Given that the incoming 
and outgoing waves are of infinite extent, this divergence
is only natural. The second term, however, depends only the
potential and can be interpreted as an excess energy due to the
cavity \cite{GAP2013}. In matrix notation, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \mat{Q} = -i\mat{S}^\dagger\frac{d\mat{S}}{dk}.
  \end{equation}
This result coincides with the \gls{qMatrix} of quantum 
mechanics \cite{SMI1960}. The interpretation of this 
matrix is facilited by \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.centralPotentialField}. 
Using the central potential, we can write
  \begin{equation}
    Q_{mm} = -ie^{-i\delta_m}\left(i\frac{\partial\delta_m}{\partial k}\right)e^{i\delta_m} = \frac{\partial\delta_m}{\partial k}.
  \end{equation}
The \gls{qMatrix} thus corresponds to the energy derivative of the 
phase shift, which has long been associated with the time-delay
introduced by the potential \cite{EIS1948,SMI1960,CAR2002}. 

The keen reader will have noticed that the above derivation
fails for complex potentials. The author has not found a proper
derivation for the extension to complex potentials. However, 
an expression can be found by this heuristic argument:
when the potential is complex, the phase shift $\delta_m$
becomes a complex function of $k$. In the preceding expression, 
we should take the inverse of the scattering matrix, not its Hermitian
transpose, to reproduce the energy derivative of the phase shift.
We thus have
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{Q} = -i\mat{S}^{-1}\frac{\partial\mat{S}}{dk}
  \end{equation}
as the proper generalization. This form was also used by Smith in
\cite{SMI1960}.
  
\subsection{Properties of the $\mat{S}$ and $\mat{Q}$ matrices}
The $\mat{S}$-matrix has multiple symmetries which can be used 
either to verify numerical implementations or to help tame 
numerical divergence issues. Most of the symmetries we will
expose in this thesis will concern the analytical continuation
of the scattering matrix in the complex $k$ plane. 

It is well known that the $\mat{S}$-matrix is unitary 
for real values of $n$ and $k$ \cite{NEW1982}. However, 
it loses this important property is lost when we extend
to the complex plane. Looking at the complex conjugated versions
of our equation set, we see that we have
  \begin{align*}
    B_m		&= S_{mm'}(n,k)A_{m'}	\\
    A_m^*	&= S_{mm'}(n^*,k^*)B_{m'}^*
  \end{align*}
we can obtain the relation
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:passive.formalism.generalizedSmatrix}
    \mat{S}^{-1}(n^*,k^*) = \mat{S}^\dagger(n,k)
  \end{equation}
which reduces to the unitarity condition when 
the values are real. 

Following \cite{GAP2013}, we set up the following scattering
``experiment'':
  \begin{align*}
    H_m^{(-)}(z)e^{im\theta}					&\rightarrow \sum_{m'} S_{m'm}(n,k)H_{m'}^{(+)}(z)e^{im'\theta}	\tag{initial reaction}\\
    \sum_{m}S_{m'm}^*(n^*,k^*)H_m^{(-)}(z)e^{im\theta}		&\rightarrow H_{m'}^{(+)}(z)e^{im'\theta}			\tag{relation \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.generalizedSmatrix}}\\
    \sum_{m}S_{m'm}(n^*,k^*)\overline{H_m^{(-)}(z)}e^{-im\theta}&\leftarrow \overline{H_{m'}^{(+)}(z)}e^{-im'\theta}.		\tag{complex conjugate (time reversal)}
  \end{align*}
Use of \eqref{eq:app.Bessel.conjHankel}
leads to the relation, valid only when $k\in\mathbb{R}$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:passive.formalism.timeReversalSymmetryReal}
    S_{m'm}(n,k) = (-1)^{m'}S_{-m-m'}(n^*,k)(-1)^m.
  \end{equation}
This relationship will be incredibly useful in the numerical implementation.

The \gls{qMatrix} also has some interesting properties. For real
potentials, it is Hermitian. This is a direct consequence of the
unitarity of the \gls{sMatrix} as 
  \begin{equation}
   \frac{d\mat{S}^\dagger\mat{S}}{dk} = \frac{d\mat{S}^\dagger}{dk}\mat{S}+\mat{S}^\dagger\frac{d\mat{S}}{dk} = 0
  \end{equation}
and
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{Q}^\dagger = i\frac{d\mat{S}^\dagger}{dk}\mat{S} = -i\mat{S}^\dagger\frac{d\mat{S}}{dk} = \mat{Q}
  \end{equation}
The delays associated with the potential are thus always real
and the delay eigenstates form a complete basis. 

\todo[inline]{Lorentzian form of the delay.}

In the complex case, the phase shifts become complex, as do the 
time delays. The imaginary part can be interpreted as an 
emission/absorption time scale. 

\section{Numerical Implementation}
The numerical computation of the scattering matrix 
depends on two constructs: a polar discretization 
scheme and interior scattering matrices. We choose, for
the former, a rather standard radial discretization (see Fig. \ref{fig:passive.numerical.radialDiscretization}).
For easier reference, we dub the method \gls{sqa}.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figs/passive/figDisScatCoeff.pdf}
 \caption[Radial discretization for use in SQA]
	 {Radial discretization of the cavity for use in \gls{sqa}. The inner circle is assumed to 
	 have a constant refractive index denoted $n_\text{in}$. The full grey lines represent
	 the physical boundaries of each shell while the dotted blue lines represent their
	 center.}
  \label{fig:passive.numerical.radialDiscretization}
\end{figure}


The latter relate the solutions of the differential equation 
inside each radial shell to its neighboring shell. The final
interior scattering matrix relates the solution in the last shell
to the exterior solution, which is analytically known and is 
related to the \gls{sMatrix}\index{scattering matrix} of the cavity.

Our method is based on an algorithm originally developed by 
Rahachou and Zozoulenko \cite{RAH2004} and extended by \cite{GAP2013}. 
We generalize the method to accept complex refractive index
profiles $n$ and wavenumbers $k$. 

\subsection{\textit{Divide et impera}}
We wish to solve the Helholtz equation 
  \begin{equation}
   \left[\nabla^2+k^2n^2\right]\psi = 0
  \end{equation}
inside the cavity. For $r>R_0$, the radius of the smallest circle
that encloses the whole dielectric, the solution is 
\eqref{eq:passive.formalism.hankelSolution}. We apply the discretization
of Fig. \ref{fig:passive.numerical.radialDiscretization}. We define a set of 
radii $\left\{r_j\right\}_{j=0}^{N+1}$ that denote the positions of the center
of the different shells. As such, $r_j-r_{j-1}=2\epsilon$ for the inner shells.
The cases $j=0$ and $j=N+1$ are different in that $r_0$ and $r_{N+1}$ denote 
the outer and inner limits of the domains, respectively. Moreover, $r_{N+1}-r_N=r_1-r_0=\epsilon\neq2\epsilon$.
As our first approximation, we suppose that the refractive index
inside the inner circle is constant and call it $n_\text{in}$. The Helmholtz equation then merely
becomes the Bessel equation \eqref{eq:app.Bessel.diffEquation}. Enforcing
finiteness of the field at $r=0$, we have the solution
  \begin{equation}
   \Ket{\psi(r)} = \sum_{m}2a_m^0J_m(n_\text{in}kr)\Ket{\Phi_m^0}	\qquad (r<r_0)
  \end{equation}
where we have introduced bra-ket notation for the angular part of the 
solution. In that case, 
  \begin{equation}
   \Braket{\theta|\Phi_m^0} = e^{im\theta}.
  \end{equation}
In the shells $j>0$, the differential equation to solve is rather
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:passive.formalism.shellDiffEquation}
    \left[\frac{d^2}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d^2}{d\theta^2}+k^2n^2(r,\theta)\right]\psi=0.
  \end{equation}
Inside each shell, we suppose that the potential strength depends only on the angular variable, i.e.
$k^2r^2n^2(r,\theta)\mapsto k^2r_j^2n^2(r_j,\theta)$ such that the angular sampling of the refractive
index is done at $r=r_j$ for each shell. \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.shellDiffEquation} 
is then amenable to a separation of variables
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \left[\rho_j^2\frac{d^2}{d\rho_j^2}+\rho_j\frac{d}{d\rho_j}-\xi^j\right]\mathcal{R}^j	&=0	\label{eq:passive.formalism.radialDiffEqn}	\\
   \left[\frac{d}{d\theta^2}+\left(k^2n^2(r_j,\theta)r_j^2+\xi^j\right)\right]\Phi^j		&=0
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where $\rho_j=r/r_j$ is the scaled radial variable of the shell. 
These equations can readily be solved by noticing that
$\Phi^j(\theta+2\pi)=\Phi^j(\theta)$. We expand the solution
in a Fourier series
  \begin{equation}
   \Braket{\theta|\Phi_\mu^j} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty c_{m\mu}^je^{im\theta}
  \end{equation}
Projecting onto $\Ket{\Phi_m'^0}$ yields
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty\left[-m^2\Braket{\Phi_{m'}^0|\Phi_m^j}+\xi^j\Braket{\Phi_{m'}^0|\Phi_m^j}+k^2r_j^2\Braket{\Phi_{m'}^0|n^2(r_j,\theta)|\Phi_m^j}\right]=0
  \end{equation}
Noticing that 
  \begin{equation}
    \Braket{\Phi_{m'}^0|\Phi_{m}^j} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty c_{m\mu}^j \delta_{mm'}
  \end{equation}
we can write
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_m\left[-m^2\delta_{mm'}+\xi^j\delta_{mm'} + \frac{k^2r_j^2}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}n^2(r,\theta)e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta\right]c_{m\mu}^j =0.
  \end{equation}
Using this last equation, we can set up an eigenvalue 
problem for the separation constant and the Fourier coefficients
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{L}^j\bo{c}_\mu^j=\xi_\mu^j\bo{c}_\mu^j
  \end{equation}
with
  \begin{equation}
    L_{mm'}^j = m^2\delta_{mm'}-\frac{k^2r_j^2}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}n^2(r_j,\theta)e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta.
  \end{equation}
In the TE case, we must take $n\mapsto n_\text{eff}$. This leads us to evaluate the 
extra integral
  \begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{n}\frac{d^2n(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta^2}-\frac{2}{n^2}\left(\frac{dn(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta.
  \end{equation}
The numerical cost of this integral can be lessened 
if we notice that if we write it as a function of $n^2$ we obtain
  \begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{2n^2}\frac{d^2n^2(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta^2}-\frac{3}{4n^4}\left(\frac{dn^2(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta
  \end{equation}
which, in turn, can be rewritten as
  \begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\log n^2(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta^2}-\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\log n^2(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta.
  \end{equation}
Integrating by parts twice yields
  \begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left[-\frac{(m-m')^2}{2}\log n^2(r_j,\theta)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\log n^2(r_j,\theta)}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]e^{i(m-m')\theta}d\theta.
  \end{equation}
The second term cannot be integrated out, but this final result means that
we will only need to numerically evaluate the first derivative of the 
refractive index (although its analytical form could be provided).

Notice the form of the $\mat{L}^j$ matrix. As can be seem from inspection, 
the value of the elements depend only on their distance from the diagonal.
Taking a closer look reveals the form
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{L}^j = \mat{M}^2 +\begin{pmatrix} 
		  n_0 & n_{-1} & \cdots & \cdots & n_{-2M}	\\
		  n_1	  & n_0& \cdots & \cdots & n_{-2M-1}\\
		  n_2	  & n_1	   & n_0& \cdots & n_{-2M-2}\\
		  \vdots  & n_2    & n_1    & \ddots & \vdots   \\
		  n_{2M}  & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & n_0
		\end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
which is manifestly Toeplitz. When the potential is real, the Fourier
series has the property $n_{-j}=n_j^*$, which makes the $\mat{L}^j$ 
matrix Hermitian. In the general case, however, it is not. Because
we will need to use orthogonality relations in what follows, we must
compute both the left and right eigenvectors\index{left eigenvectors}. 
We will note the left (covariant) basis by $\Ket{\tilde{\Phi}_\mu^j}$.
This is not sufficient, however, because we are not guaranteed that
both sets of eigenvectors will form a complete basis. 

Now that we know the set of eigenvalues $\{\xi_\mu^j\}$, we can solve the radial
equation \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.radialDiffEqn}. It is instantly recognized as 
a Cauchy-Euler equation. Given its coefficients, one can write the solution 
as \cite[p.~118-119]{GRE98}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sMatrix.radialSolution}
    \mathcal{R}_\mu^j(r) =  a_\mu^j\rho_j^{+\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}+b_\mu^j\rho_j^{-\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}.
  \end{equation}
The solution is now known in all space. We can now apply the boundary conditions \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.cylindricalBoundaryConditions}
at the interface of each shell $j\rightarrow j+1$. The process generates two sets of equations
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
   \sum_\mu\left[a_\mu^j\rho_j^{+\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}+b_\mu^j\rho_j^{-\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}\right]\Ket{\Phi_\mu^j}
   &=
   \sum_\mu\left[b_\mu^{j+1}\rho_{j+1}^{+\sqrt{\xi_\mu^{j+1}}}+a_\mu^{j+1}\rho_{j+1}^{-\sqrt{\xi_\mu^{j+1}}}\right]\Ket{\Phi_\mu^{j+1}}	\\
   \eta_j\frac{d}{dr}\sum_\mu\left[a_\mu^j\rho_j^{+\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}+b_\mu^j\rho_j^{-\sqrt{\xi_\mu^j}}\right]\Ket{\Phi_\mu^j}
   &=
   \eta_{j+1}\frac{d}{dr}\sum_\mu\left[b_\mu^{j+1}\rho_{j+1}^{+\sqrt{\xi_\mu^{j+1}}}+b_\mu^{j+1}\rho_{j+1}^{-\sqrt{\xi_\mu^{j+1}}}\right]\Ket{\Phi_\mu^{j+1}}
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
where $\eta_j = 1\, (1/n(r_j,\theta))$ in TM (TE) polarization. The interior scattering matrices
are constructed via premultiplying by the left eigenvectors $\Bra{\tilde{\Phi}_\mu^j}$ on each side. 
Combining both resulting equations leads to the linear system 
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}\mat{A} & \mat{B} \\ \mat{C} & \mat{D} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \bo{a}^j \\ \bo{a}^{j+1}\end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}\mat{E} & \mat{F} \\ \mat{G} & \mat{H} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \bo{b}^j \\ \bo{b}^{j+1}\end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
which can be inverted using Schur's complements  to yield a relationship between the 
$\bo{a}$ and $\bo{b}$ coefficients. The matrix relating
the four sets of coefficients is an \textit{interior scattering
matrix}, $\mat{S}^j$. Physically, this relates the locally 
incoming waves from shell $j+1$ in shell $j$ to the locally 
outgoing from shell $j$ to shell $j+1$. The last necessary
breakthrough is to realize that we can connect the solutions
from shell $j$ to those of the shell $j+2$, then $j+3$ and 
so on. When started from $j=0$, this iterative process yields
the relationship
  \begin{equation}
   \begin{pmatrix}\bo{a}^0\\\bo{B}\end{pmatrix} = \mat{S}^{0,N}\begin{pmatrix}\bo{a}^0\\\bo{A}\end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
such that the \gls{sMatrix} of the system is
the block $\mat{S}_{22}^{0,N}$. More details can be found
in Appendix \ref{sec:app.numTools.scatMat}. 
  
\subsection{Numerical Analysis and Calibration}
While numerical analysis has been heavily formalized in recent years, 
it is still as much an art as a science. In implementing the algorithm, 
we thus came across two potential problems: the inversion of the 
$\mat{K}$ matrix (defined below) and the final Hadamard product
$\mathcal{H}\circ\mat{S}^{0,N}_{22}$. We analyze the two issues
and provide solutions to the instability they cause. We also 
calibrate the method with systems whose analytical solution
is known: the homogeneous circular cavity and the annular cavity.
We also compare our method to results obtained in the literature. 

\subsubsection{Numerical Back and Forth}
At each step of the algorith, we must invert
a matrix of the form 
  \begin{equation}
  \mat{K}^{j,j+1} = \left(\frac{r_j-\epsilon}{r_j+\epsilon}\right)^{\bo{\Lambda}^j}
		    -\tilde{\mat{S}}^{j+1}_{11}\left(\frac{r_j+\epsilon}{r_j-\epsilon}\right)^{\bo{\Lambda}^j}\tilde{\mat{S}}^{0,j}_{22}.
  \end{equation}
Given that the elements of this matrix highly depend upon the discretization
parameter $\epsilon$, the half-width of the shells, we can use the
condition number $W$ of this matrix as an indicator of the quality
of the discretization. It can be grossly estimated by the 
ratio of the maximum and minimum elements of the matrix. 
By assuming that there is no amplification in the system,
all interior scattering matrices have
$||\mat{S}||<1$ and we can approximate
  \begin{equation}
   W \sim 1 + \frac{4\lambda_\text{max}\epsilon}{r_j}.
  \end{equation}
The $\lambda_\text{max}$ parameter depends solely on the 
Fourier components of the refractive index. Given that most 
cavities that will study will be mildly inhomogenous, 
i.e. that $|n_0|\geq|n_m|$, we posit the upper bound 
$|\lambda_\text{max}| < 3nkR_0$. A good choice of 
$\epsilon$ is thus
  \begin{equation}
   \epsilon \ll \frac{1}{12nk} \ll \frac{\lambda}{2n}
  \end{equation}
which mirrors the conventional wisdom. This empirical rule
is applied in every computation in this thesis. 
\todo[inline]{Introduction to Gerschgorin circles and possibility of inversion problems of $\mat{K}$.}

\subsubsection{Hadamard Product}
Like Frodo before Mount Doom, we must face a final challenge
before conquering upon all evil, or, in our case, computing
the scattering matrix. Our final demon
takes the form of the product
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{S} = \left[\mat{H}^{(+)}\right]^{-1}\mat{S}^{0,N}_{22}\mat{H}^{(-)}
  \end{equation}
where the $\mat{H}$ are diagonal matrices with entries $H_m^{(\pm)}(n_okR_0)$. 
We recast the matrix product as a Hadamard (element-wise) product
 \begin{equation}
  \mat{S} = \mathcal{H}\circ\mat{S}^{0,N}_{22}
 \end{equation}
with $\mathcal{H}_{mm'} = H_m^{(-)}(n_okR_0)/H_{m'}^{(+)}(n_okR_0)$.
A quick peek at Fig. \ref{fig:passive.numerical.hankelHadamard} 
announces the disaster. The region $|m'|>|m|$ increases 
exponentially with $|m'|-|m|$. This wouldn't be an issue 
if the corresponding elements of the block scattering
matrix $\mat{S}^{0,N}_{22}$ were exponentially decreasing (as
we physically expect them to); however, the numerical construction
of this matrix implies the addition and substraction of $\mathcal{O}(1)$
floating-point numbers, limiting their range to about $10^{-15}$, the decimal
accuracy associated with \texttt{double} precision arithmetic. Consequently, 
the final Hadamard product yields scattering matrices with unphysically
large off-diagonal elements.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics{figs/passive/absHadamard.pdf}
 \caption[General form of absolute value of the Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}$]
	 {General form of absolute value of the Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}$.
	 We have used the parameters $z=10$ and $M=100$, but
	  the pattern scales with $M$ and $z$.}
 \label{fig:passive.numerical.hankelHadamard}
\end{figure}

Several solutions have been considered, e.g. the use of matrix masks
and of higher precision arithmetic. The latter was swiftly abandoned
due to the difficulty of the implementation\footnote{Even if we disregard
the fact that no C++ compiler support the IEEE 754 \texttt{binary128}
quadruple precision float-point representation, we would still need
to find numerical libraries that extend the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
to work at higher precision.}, even though it could help stabilize the
numerical algorithm \cite[\S 5.8.4]{MIS2002}. The use of matrix masks is 
made possible by noting that the cavity cannot convert arbitrarily
high angular momenta. The maximum angular momentum it can affect, 
$M_\text{max}$ is a function of its ``degree of inhomogeity'', 
characterized by the absolute size of the Fourier components
of the refractive index (which also depend on the geometry
of the cavity). This gives the \gls{sMatrix} a banded form 
\todo{Show the S-matrix of the quadrupolar cavity}. The width of
this band could be detected in $\mat{S}^{0,N}_{22}$ before
taking the Hadamard product. After the product, all elements
outside this band could be set to zero. The interested 
reader might want to go through Türeci's discussion of
the banded form and the numerical problems associated 
with the Hankel matrices \cite[\S 3.4]{TUR2003}.

We have, however, chosen a different path. 
It turns out that relation \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.timeReversalSymmetryReal}
precisely relates the diverging parts of the Hankel matrix
to its vanishing one. Imposing this symmetry on the numerical scattering
matrix allows the algorithm to return physical scattering matrices. 

\subsubsection{Calibration}
One of the most important step in algorithmic creation
is the \textit{\gls{calPhase}}. Ours was calibrated
against two cavities: the homogeneous circular cavity and 
the annular cavity. Their analytical form is given below.

The scattering matrix of the homogeneous circular cavity
is trivially obtained. Assuming that the refractive index inside
the cavity is $n_c$ and $n_o$ outside, the solution inside the 
cavity is given by 
  \begin{equation}
   \psi^c = \sum_m a_m^cJ_m(n_okr)e^{im\theta}
  \end{equation}
while the solution outside the cavity is given by \eqref{eq:passive.formalism.hankelSolution}.
Imposing the electromagnetic boundary conditions yields two infinite sets of equations
for three sets of coefficients. Solving yields a linear relationship between the 
$A_m$ and $B_m$ sets, \textit{viz.} the scattering matrix
  \begin{equation}
   S_{mm'}^\text{HD} = -  \frac{\eta_{co}J_m'(Z_c)H_m^{(-)}(Z_o)-J_m(Z_c){H^{(-)}_m}'(Z_o)}
				{\eta_{co}J_m'(Z_c)H_m^{(+)}(Z_o)-J_m(Z_c){H^{(+)}_m}'(Z_o)}\delta_{mm'}.
  \end{equation}
where $Z_c = n_ckR_0$, $Z_o=n_okR_0$ and $\eta_{co}= n_c/n_o\; (n_o/n_c)$ in TM (TE) polarization.

	  size.}
 \label{fig:passive.numerical.convergenceHomogeneousDisk}
\end{figure}

Derivation of the scattering matrix of the annular cavity is a little
more involved. Suffice it to say that it is given by 
  \begin{equation}
   \mat{S}^\text{AC} = -\left[n_o{\mat{H}^{(-)}}'(Z_o)-n_c\mat{H}^{(-)}(Z_o)\mat{GF}^{-1}\right]
			\left[n_o{\mat{H}^{(+)}}'(Z_o)-n_c\mat{H}^{(+)}(Z_o)\mat{GF}^{-1}\right]^{-1}
  \end{equation}
where 
  \begin{align}
   \mat{F} &= \mat{H}^{(-)}(Z_c)+\mat{H}^{(+)}(Z_c)\mat{S}^\text{HD} & \mat{G} = {\mat{H}^{(-)}}'(Z_c)+{\mat{H}^{(+)}}'(Z_c)\mat{S}^\text{HD}.
  \end{align}
A proper derivation can be found in \cite{HEN2002}; an improved
one can be found in \cite[Appendix D]{GAP2013}.

\section{Case Study: Gaussian Deformation of the Refractive Index}
As an academic demonstration of the power of the method, 
we present a study of a circular cavity whose refractive index
has a Gaussian shape
  \begin{equation}
   n(r,\theta) = n_0 + \delta n\exp\left[-\frac{r^2+2dr\cos\left(\Theta-\theta\right)+d^2}{2w^2}\right],
  \end{equation}
where $n_0$ is the background refractive index, $\delta _n$ the 
deformation amplitude, $w$ its half-width and $(d,\Theta)$
its position relative to the center of the cavity. 

As previously noted by G.~P-A. \cite{GAP2013}, a peculiar
duality exists between high-$Q$ resonances and directional emission.
Working with a cavity similar to the annular one, it stands to reason
that we will recover the same pattern. However, this study will be used
as a stepping stone for our inquiries in the realm of non-uniformly
pumped active microcavities. 

\subsection{Loss of Integrability and the KAM Scenario}
When $d=0$, the potential is central and angular momentum is 
necessarily conserved. If the system is also unitary
(no absorption nor gain), it can be shown that the system is
integrable\footnote{The covariant form of Maxwell's equation and their
associated Euler-Lagrange equation make this conservation perfectly clear.}. 
This conservation of angular momentum in turn
implies circular symmetry of the fields and hence of the 
far-field radiation pattern. Since most applications (particularly lasers)
require a certain directionality in the emission, our goal is to break 
the circular symmetry in such a way as to minimize the degradation of the
finesse ($Q$-factor) and maximizing the output directionality. Historically, 
this goal has spawned the research field of \glspl{arc} wherein the boundary
of the circular cavity is parametrically deformed to yield limaçon, stadium, 
elliptical, quadrupolar, etc. shapes.

\subsection{Geodesics and Ray Analysis}
While our numerical method allows us tu perform full-wave
simulations of cavities, it is often useful to consider the associated
billiard system, which is the small wavelength approximation of 
Helmholtz's equation. In homogeneous ARCS, photons follow straight path
trajectories and are specularly reflected at the interfaces. In inhomogeneous
ARCs, photons follow curved trajectories that obey Fermat's principle. 
The general equations defining those \textit{geodesic} paths can be found
by using the metric
  \begin{equation}
   (dt)^2=g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu. 
  \end{equation}
The time it takes to travel a particular trajectory is given by
  \begin{equation}
   t = \int_{\lambda_0}^{\lambda_1} \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu}\,d\lambda
  \end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a parameter of the curve. Applying the Euler-Lagrange
equation 
  \begin{align}
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial x^\alpha}-\frac{d}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{x}^\alpha}=0
  \end{align}
on the functional $L=\sqrt{w}=\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu}\,d\lambda$ minimizes the time it takes to travel
from one point to another. Evaluating the derivatives
  \begin{align*}
  0	&=\frac{\partial\left(\sqrt{w}\right)}{\partial x^\alpha}-\frac{d}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial\left(\sqrt{w}\right)}{\partial\dot{x}^\alpha}	\\
  {}	&=\frac{\partial w}{\partial x^\alpha}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{w}}\frac{dw}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial w}{\partial\dot{x}^\alpha}-\frac{d}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial w}{\partial\dot{x}^\alpha}
  \end{align*}
When $\lambda$ is an affine parameter, the derivative $dw/d\lambda$ vanishes \cite{TOP2005,SCH2009}
and the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial x^\alpha}			&= \frac{d}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial w}{\partial\dot{x}^\alpha}	\\
  g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu		&= \frac{d}{d\lambda}\left[g_{\mu\nu}{\delta_\alpha}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu+g_{\mu\nu}{\delta_\alpha}^\nu\dot{x}^\mu\right]	\\
							&= \frac{d}{d\lambda}\left[g_{\alpha\nu}\dot{x}^\nu+g_{\mu\alpha}\dot{x}^\mu\right]					\\
							&= g_{\alpha\nu,\lambda}\dot{x}^\lambda\dot{x}^\nu+g_{\alpha\nu}\ddot{x}^\nu+g_{\mu\alpha,\lambda}\dot{x}^\lambda\dot{x}^\mu+g_{\mu\alpha}\ddot{x}^\mu \tag{chain rule: $\frac{dg_{\mu\nu}}{d\lambda}=\frac{\partial g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\lambda}\frac{dx^\lambda}{d\lambda}$}	\\
  g_{\alpha\nu}\ddot{x}^\nu+g_{\mu\alpha}\ddot{x}^\mu	&= \dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu\left[g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}-g_{\alpha\nu,\mu}-g_{\mu\alpha,\nu}\right]	\tag{collecting differentiation orders}	\\
  {\delta^\sigma}_\mu\ddot{x}^\mu			&= \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\alpha}\left[g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}-g_{\alpha\nu,\mu}-g_{\alpha\mu,\nu}\right]\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu	\tag{symmetry of $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\times g^{\sigma\alpha}$}
  \end{align*}
This finally yields the equation
  \begin{equation}
   \ddot{x}^\sigma + {\Gamma^\sigma}_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu=0
  \end{equation}
where ${\Gamma^\sigma}_{\mu\nu}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind.
