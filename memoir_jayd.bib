abstract = {Motivated by applications in optics and acoustics we develop a dynamical-system approach to describe absorption in chaotic systems. We introduce an operator formalism from which we obtain (i) a general formula for the escape rate $\kappa$ in terms of the natural conditionally invariant measure of the system, (ii) an increased multifractality when compared to the spectrum of dimensions Dq obtained without taking absorption and return times into account, and (iii) a generalization of the Kantz-Grassberger formula that expresses D1 in terms of $\kappa$, the positive Lyapunov exponent, the average return time, and a new quantity, the reflection rate. Simulations in the cardioid billiard confirm these results.},

abstract = {In conventional lasers, the optical cavity that confines the photons also determines essential characteristics of the lasing modes such as wavelength, emission pattern, directivity, and polarization. In random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a well-defined cavity, light is confined within the gain medium by means of multiple scattering. The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor powders, first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant feedback. We review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at clarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with gain. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of the idea that even the low-Q resonances of such open systems could play a role similar to the cavity modes of a conventional laser and produce sharp lasing peaks. We focus here on the near-threshold single-mode lasing regime where nonlinear effects associated with gain saturation and mode competition can be neglected. We discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near threshold and the resonances or quasi-bound (QB) states of the passive system without gain. For random lasers in the localized (strong scattering) regime, QB states and threshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering medium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems such as random systems in the diffusive regime, where it was observed that increasing the openness of such systems eventually resulted in measurable and increasing differences between quasi-bound states and lasing modes. Very recently, a theory able to treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random lasers established that the threshold lasing modes are in fact distinct from QB states of the passive system and are better described in terms of a new class of states, the so-called constant-flux states. The correspondence between QB states and lasing modes is found to improve in the strong scattering limit, confirming the validity of initial work in the strong scattering limit.},

abstract = {Current single-molecule detection techniques require labeling the target molecule. We report a highly specific and sensitive optical sensor based on an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor (Q > 108) whispering-gallery microcavity. The silica surface is functionalized to bind the target molecule; binding is detected by a resonant wavelength shift. Single-molecule detection is confirmed by observation of single-molecule binding events that shift the resonant frequency, as well as by the statistics for these shifts over many binding events. These shifts result from a thermo-optic mechanism. Additionally, label-free, single-molecule detection of interleukin-2 was demonstrated in serum. These experiments demonstrate a dynamic range of 1012 in concentration, establishing the microcavity as a sensitive and versatile detector.},

abstract = {The circulation of light within dielectric volumes enables storage of optical power near specific resonant frequencies and is important in a wide range of fields including cavity quantum electrodynamics, photonics, biosensing and nonlinear optics. Optical trajectories occur near the interface of the volume with its surroundings, making their performance strongly dependent upon interface quality. With a nearly atomic-scale surface finish, surface-tension-induced microcavities such as liquid droplets or spheres are superior to all other dielectric microresonant structures when comparing photon lifetime or, equivalently, cavity Q factor. Despite these advantageous properties, the physical characteristics of such systems are not easily controlled during fabrication. It is known that wafer-based processing of resonators can achieve parallel processing and control, as well as integration with other functions. However, such resonators-on-a-chip suffer from Q factors that are many orders of magnitude lower than for surface-tension-induced microcavities, making them unsuitable for ultra-high-Q experiments. Here we demonstrate a process for producing silica toroid-shaped microresonators-on-a-chip with Q factors in excess of 100 million using a combination of lithography, dry etching and a selective reflow process. Such a high Q value was previously attainable only by droplets or microspheres and represents an improvement of nearly four orders of magnitude over previous chip-based resonators.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of quantum localization in classically chaotic eigenstates is one of the main issues in quantum chaos (or wave chaos), and thus plays an important role in general quantum mechanics or even in general wave mechanics. In this work we propose two different localization measures characterizing the degree of quantum localization, and study their relation to another fundamental aspect of quantum chaos, namely the (energy) spectral statistics. Our approach and method is quite general, and we apply it to billiard systems. One of the signatures of the localization of chaotic eigenstates is a fractional power-law repulsion between the nearest energy levels in the sense that the probability density to find successive levels on a distance S goes like ∝S$\beta$ for small S, where 0≤$\beta$≤1, and $\beta$=1 corresponds to completely extended states. We show that there is a clear functional relation between the exponent $\beta$ and the two different localization measures. One is based on the information entropy and the other one on the correlation properties of the Husimi functions. We show that the two definitions are surprisingly linearly equivalent. The approach is applied in the case of a mixed-type billiard system [ M. Robnik J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 16 3971 (1983)], in which the separation of regular and chaotic eigenstates is performed.},

abstract = {The treatment of boundary value problems in various vector-separable regimes is unified and facilitated with the use of the eigenvector expansion of their corresponding Green's tensors. In particular, the method is useful for the vector Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz and Navier equations in spherical and cylindrical polars. Several examples are given; among them, an evaluation of the dynamic and static response of an elastic sphere to shear dislocations requires particular mention. It is found that the static displacement field in a sphere which is associated with the Legendre polynomial of the first degree (l = 1) poses some problems. In such a case, one must incorporate additional conditions, namely, that the angular momentum of the sphere about its centre is zero and that the centre of mass of the sphere is not displaced. It is recommended that eigenvector expansions be adopted in geophysical theory. Its inherent elegance and compactness make it an excellent tool for the construction of theoretical Earth-models.},

The observed deviations between the experimental length spectra and the predictions of the trace formula are attributed to a large number of missing resonances in the measured spectra. We show that by taking into account the systematics of observed and missing resonances the experimental length spectra are fully understood. In particular, a connection between the most long-lived resonances and certain periodic orbits is established experimentally.},

abstract = {Due to ultra high quality factor (10(6) - 10(9)), axisymmetric optical microcavities are popular platforms for biosensing applications. It has been recently demonstrated that a microcavity biosensor can track a biodetection event as a function of its quality factor by using phase shift cavity ring down spectroscopy (PS-CRDS). However, to achieve maximum sensitivity, it is necessary to optimize the microcavity parameters for a given sensing application. Here, we introduce an improved finite element model which allows us to determine the optimized geometry for the PS-CRDS sensor. The improved model not only provides fast and accurate determination of quality factors but also determines the tunneling distance of axisymmetric resonators. The improved model is validated numerically, analytically, and experimentally.},

The formalism may be applied to scatterers of different shapes and embedded in different background media, and we develop it in detail for the specific case of spherical scatterers in a homogeneous background medium. In addition, we show how several physically important quantities may readily be calculated with the formalism. These quantities include the extinction cross section, the total Green’s tensor, the projected local density of states, and the Purcell factor as well as the quasi-normal modes of leaky resonators with the associated resonance frequencies and quality factors. We demonstrate the calculations for the well-known plasmonic dimer consisting of two silver nanoparticles and thus illustrate the versatility of the formalism for use in modeling of advanced nanophotonic devices.},

abstract = {Circular microresonators are micron-sized dielectric disks embedded in material of lower refractive index. They possess modes of extremely high Q-factors (low-lasing thresholds), which makes them ideal candidates for the realization of miniature laser sources. They have, however, the disadvantage of isotropic light emission caused by the rotational symmetry of the system. In order to obtain high directivity of the emission while retaining high Q-factors, we consider a microdisk with a pointlike scatterer placed off-center inside of the disk. We calculate the resulting resonant modes and show that some of them possess both of the desired characteristics. The emission is predominantly in the direction opposite to the scatterer. We show that classical ray optics is a useful guide to optimizing the design parameters of this system. We further find that exceptional points in the resonance spectrum influence how complex resonance wave numbers change if system parameters are varied.},

abstract = {We use Thomson’s classical concept of mode of a leaky cavity to develop a quantum theory of cavity damping. This theory generalizes the conventional system-reservoir theory of high-Q cavity damping to arbitrary Q. The small system now consists of damped oscillators corresponding to the natural modes of the leaky cavity rather than undamped oscillators associated with the normal modes of a fictitious perfect cavity. The formalism unifies semiclassical Fox-Li modes and the normal modes traditionally used for quantization. It also lays the foundations for a full quantum description of excess noise. The connection with Siegman’s semiclassical work is straightforward. In a wider context, this theory constitutes a radical departure from present models of dissipation in quantum mechanics: unlike conventional models, system and reservoir operators no longer commute with each other. This noncommutability is an unavoidable consequence of having to use natural cavity modes rather than normal modes of a fictitious perfect cavity.},

The method can deal with multiple lossy or lossless dielectric objects of arbitrary geometry, be they nested, in contact, or dispersed. Several examples are used to demonstrate that this method is able to efficiently handle 3D photonic scatterers involving large numbers of unknowns. Absorption, scattering, and extinction efficiencies of gold nanoparticle spheres, calculated by the MLFMM, are compared with Mie’s theory. MLFMM calculations of the bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of a gold sphere near the plasmon resonance and of a silica coated gold sphere are also compared with Mie theory predictions.

abstract = {We review recent progress in analysing wave scattering in systems with both intrinsic chaos and/or disorder and internal losses, when the scattering matrix is no longer unitary. By mapping the problem onto a nonlinear supersymmetric $\sigma$-model, we are able to derive closed-form analytic expressions for the distribution of reflection probability in a generic disordered system. One of the most important properties resulting from such an analysis is statistical independence between the phase and the modulus of the reflection amplitude in every perfectly open channel. The developed theory has far-reaching consequences for many quantities of interest, including local Green functions and time delays. In particular, we point out the role played by absorption as a sensitive indicator of mechanisms behind the Anderson localization transition. We also provide a random-matrix-based analysis of S-matrix and impedance correlations for various symmetry classes as well as the distribution of transmitted power for systems with broken time-reversal invariance, completing previous works on the subject. The results can be applied, in particular, to the experimentally accessible impedance and reflection in a microwave or an ultrasonic cavity attached to a system of antennas.},

abstract = {A large body of work has accumulated over the years in the study of the optical properties of single and coupled microcavities for a variety of applications, ranging from filters to sensors and lasers. The focus has been mostly on the geometry of individual resonators and/or on their combination in arrangements often referred to as photonic molecules (PMs). Our primary concern will be the lasing properties of PMs as ideal candidates for the fabrication of integrated microlasers, photonic molecule lasers. Whereas most calculations on PM lasers have been based on cold-cavity (passive) modes, i.e. quasi-bound states, a recently formulated steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) offers the possibility to take into account the spectral properties of the underlying gain transition, its position and linewidth, as well as incorporating an arbitrary pump profile. We will combine two theoretical approaches to characterize the lasing properties of PM lasers: for two-dimensional systems, the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory will obtain the resonant modes of the coupled molecules in an active medium described by SALT. Not only is then the theoretical description more complete, the use of an active medium provides additional parameters to control, engineer and harness the lasing properties of PM lasers for ultra-low threshold and directional single-mode emission.},

abstract = {Optical devices based on photonic crystals such as waveguides, lenses and beam-shapers, have received considerable theoretical and experimental attention in recent years. The production of these devices has been facilitated by the wide availability of silicon-on-insulator fabrication techniques. In this theoretical work, we show the possibility to design a coherent PhC-based beam-shaper. The basic photonic geometry used is a 2D square lattice of air holes in a high-index dielectric core. We formulate the beam shaping problem in terms of objective functions related to the amplitude and phase profile of the generated beam. We then use a parallel tabu search algorithm to minimize the two objectives simultaneously. Our results show that optimization of several attributes in integrated photonics design is well within reach of current algorithms.},

To assess the potential of this algorithm, we consider the problem of beam shaping using a two-dimensional arrangement of dielectric scatterers. The performance of PTS is compared to one of the most widely used optimization algorithms in photonics design, the genetic algorithm (GA). We find that PTS can produce comparable or better solutions than the GA, while requiring less computation time and fewer adjustable parameters. For the coherent beam shaping problem as a case study, we demonstrate how PTS can tackle multiobjective optimization problems and represent a robust and efficient alternative to GA.},

abstract = {We improve the steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) of T\"{u}reci et al. by expressing its fundamental self-consistent equation in a basis set of threshold constant flux states that contains the exact threshold lasing mode. For cavities with nonuniform index and/or nonuniform gain, the new basis set allows the steady-state lasing properties to be computed with much greater efficiency. This formulation of the SALT can be solved in the single-pole approximation, which gives the intensities and thresholds, including the effects of nonlinear hole-burning interactions to all orders, with negligible computational effort. The approximation yields a number of analytic predictions, including a “gain-clamping” transition at which strong modal interactions suppress all higher modes. We show that the single-pole approximation agrees well with exact SALT calculations, particularly for high-Q cavities. Within this range of validity, it provides an extraordinarily efficient technique for modeling realistic and complex lasers.},

It differs from conventional billiards with hard-wall boundary conditions in that it is partially open and composed of two dielectric media with different refractive indices. The interplay of reflection and transmission at the different interfaces gives rise to rich dynamics of classical light rays and to a variety of wave phenomena. We study the ray propagation in terms of Poincar\'{e} surfaces of section and complement it with full numerical solutions of the corresponding wave equations. We introduce and develop an S-matrix approach to open optical cavities which proves very suitable for the identification of resonances of intermediate width that will be most important in future applications like optical communication devices. We show that the Husimi representation is a useful tool in characterizing resonances and establish the ray-wave correspondence in real and phase space. While the simple ray picture provides a good qualitative description of certain system classes, only the wave description reveals the quantitative details.},

We obtained this accuracy by considering scattering by spheres and comparing the simulated internal and scattered fields with those obtained by Mie theory. The accuracy was measured in several error norms (e.g., mean and root mean square). Furthermore, the distribution of the errors within the particle was obtained. The accuracy was measured as a function of the size parameter and the refractive index of the sphere and as a function of the cube size used in the simulations. The size parameter of the sphere was as large as 10, and three refractive indices were considered. The errors in the internal field are located mostly on the surface of the sphere, and even for fine discretizations they remain relatively large. The errors depend strongly on the refractive index of the particle. If the discretization is kept constant, the errors depend only weakly on the size parameter. We also examined the case of sharp internal field resonances in the sphere. We show that the simulation is able to reproduce the resonances in the internal field, although at a slightly larger refractive index.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of local dynamics on chaos-assisted tunneling in a highly deformed microcavity whose classical ray dynamics exhibits a small measure of trapezoidal-shaped orbit (TSO) stability islands in a main chaotic sea. These two classically completely decomposed regions in phase space can support resonance modes of their own respectively. Using numerical ray and wave analyses, we show that the emission characteristics of the TSO resonance mode are determined by local ray dynamics near TSO islands. The emission characteristics of the other high-Q resonance modes, on the other hand, are governed by usual ray-wave correspondence. We experimentally demonstrate that the TSO emission mode can be lased without selective excitations by devising a half-moon shaped highly deformed cavity. And we also show that the emission characteristics of the TSO lasing modes are well explained by numerical ray and wave analyses.},

In this approach, the spurious, nonphysical solutions do not appear anywhere above the "air-line," and therefore the present formulation is very useful for the analysis of the surface-wave modes of dielectric waveguides. The application of this improved finite-element method to the dielectric waveguides with perfect electric and magnetic conductors is also discussed. In particular, the discussion is how to use the conditions on a boundary surface of a perfect electric or magnetic conductor whose normal direction is not coincident with the direction of a coordinate axis. Application of these boundary conditions for perfect conductors to the dielectric waveguides with planes of symmetry reduces the matrix size. The strength of this approach to boundary conditions is not just the economical use of computer memory but the elimination of spurious solutions through rigorous enforcement of boundary conditions as well.},

A selection rule for strong inter-mode coupling induced by RADT was observed on angular mode numbers as predicted by the RADT theory. In addition, the coupling strength was measured to be proportional to the square of the phase-space area associated with the nonlinear resonance involved in RADT. The proportionality constant was found to depend only on the nonlinear resonance, supporting the semiclassical nature of RADT.},

abstract = {The near-threshold lasing modes of active microcavities and the corresponding passive resonances of the bare cavities, obtained using the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bloch model and the boundary element method, respectively, are known to possess almost identical wave intensity patterns. Here, we investigate how much they resemble each other in phase space. It is shown that a clear distinction between them can be seen in the Husimi function, a phase-space representation of the resonance mode, despite their almost identical appearance in configuration space. For optical microcavities, one can distinguish two Husimi functions inside the cavity, namely one describing the wave components incident to the boundary and the other one describing (reflected) components emerging from the boundary but remaining inside the cavity. They are referred to as incident and emerging Husimi functions, respectively. We find the incident and emerging Husimi functions of the lasing mode to show a pronounced asymmetric localization in phase space, whereas the corresponding passive-case quantities look very similar. This can be understood by adding the amplification process, inherent and characteristic for the laser, to the passive mode. We also discuss possible effects of the resulting nonlinear dynamics for a single lasing mode as well as for two-mode lasing that is relevant at higher pumping strength. We demonstrate its consequences in terms of the Husimi functions that we find to be the adequate tool to illustrate features of the amplification process.},

In that connection we emphasize the shortcomings of the commonly accepted Lorentz derivation for the internal field and restate a less well known existing alternative derivation. The symmetrical and unsymmetrical effective medium theories of Bruggeman are presented. Connection is made to transport in randomly chosen resistor networks, to percolation threshold problems, and to transport in magnetic fields in the presence of inhomogeneities. Two more specialized topics are also discussed. One of these is the variability in field effect transistor thresholds arising from the limited size of the samples in which threshold is determined by the onset of percolation. The other specialized topic: The occurrence of strong spatial inhomogeneities in fields and currents in metals, in the presence of lattice defects, even though the mean free path is large compared to the extent of the defect.},

Focusing on electromagnetic scattering, we highlight an alternative formulation of the T-matrix approach, based on the use of the reactance matrix or K matrix, which is more suited to formal studies of energy-conservation constraints (such as the optical theorem). We show in particular that electrostatics or quasistatic approximations can be corrected within this framework to satisfy the energy-conservation constraints associated with radiation. A general formula for such a radiative correction is explicitly obtained, and empirical expressions proposed in earlier studies are shown to be special cases of this general formula. This work therefore provides a justification of the empirical radiative correction to the dipolar polarizability and a generalization of this correction to any types of point or body scatterers of arbitrary shapes, including higher multipolar orders.},

abstract = {Resonances arising in elastic scattering or emission prob- lems are investigated as a probe of the Kolmogorov-Arnol’d- Moser (KAM) transition to chaos and its wave manifesta- tions. The breaking of symmetries that leads to this transi- tion affects all the intrinsic properties of a resonance, which suggests applications where these properties can be con- trolled and predicted in parameter ranges beyond the reach of perturbation theory. Convex dielectric optical microcavties are studied which sup- port long-lived “whispering-gallery” (WG) modes that clas- sically correspond to rays trapped by total internal reflection in orbits close to the interface with the outside lower-index medium. These resonantors with substantial but always con- vex deformation are termed asymmetric resonant cavities (ARCs). The connection between individual resonances and ray ensembles in an asymmetric billiard is established via a novel application of Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quanti- zation, based on the adiabatic approximation of Robnik and Berry which describesWG trajectories even when the defor- mation exceeds the threshold at which Lazutkin’s caustics cease to exist in the relevant regions of phase space. At such strong distortions, resonance lifetimes are determined not by the wavelength as in symmetric cavities, but by the classical diffusion time from the EBK initial condition in phase space to an escape window corresponding to classical violation of the total internal reflection condition. Instead of the isotropic emission from rotationally invari- ant objects, highly asymmetric resonantors exhibit strongly peaked intensity in directions which can be predicted from the phase space structure near the classical escape window. This creates unambiguous fingerprints of the KAM transi- tion in the emission anisotropy of ARCs, which are universal for all classically chaotic WG modes. Ray calculations are compared to numerical wave solutions as well as to experi- ments, and good agreement is found especially for the direc- tionality. Ray predictions for the lifetimes fail when wave mechanical corrections such as chaos-assisted tunneling and dynamical localization are important.},

abstract = {This paper explains how a popular commercially available software package for solving partial-differential-equations (PDEs), as based on the finite-element method, can be configured to efficiently calculate the frequencies and fields of the whispering-gallery (WG) modes of axisymmetric dielectric resonators. The approach is traceable; it exploits the PDE-solver's ability to accept the definition of solutions to Maxwell's equations in so-called weak form. Associated expressions and methods for estimating a WG mode's volume, filling factor(s), and in the case of closed (open) resonators, its wall (radiation) loss, are provided. As no transverse approximation is imposed, the approach remains accurate even for quasi-transverse-magnetic/electric modes of low finite azimuthal mode order. The approach's generality and utility are demonstrated by modeling several nontrivial structures, i.e., 1) two different optical microcavities (one toroidal made of silica, the other an AlGaAs microdisk), 2) a third-order sapphire:air Bragg cavity, and 3) two different cryogenic sapphire WG-mode resonators; both 2) and 3) operate in the microwave X-band. By fitting one of 3) to a set of measured resonance frequencies, the dielectric constants of sapphire at liquid-helium temperature have been estimated.},

The method is based on a scattering formalism to obtain the position and width of the (quasi)-eigenmodes. The core of the method lies in the scattering S-matrix and its associated delay Q-matrix which contain all the relevant information of the corresponding scattering experiment.

The mounds grow in width w and height h as a function of layer thickness t from h=3 nm and w=20 nm for t=20 nm to h=5 nm and w=200 nm for t=1.2 $\mu$m. The resistivity increases with decreasing layer thickness from 1.70 $\mu$$\Omega$-cm for t=1.2 $\mu$m to 8.35 $\mu$$\Omega$-cm for t=6.6 nm. The resistivity increase is consistent with the Fuchs–Sondheimer model for completely diffuse surface scattering.

abstract = {In this report we provide an overview of the open source Armadillo C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths). The library aims to have a good balance between speed and ease of use, and is useful if C++ is the language of choice (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language like Matlab or Octave. In particular, Armadillo can be used for fast prototyping and computationally intensive experiments, while at the same time allowing for relatively painless transition of research code into production environments. It is distributed under a license that is applicable in both open source and proprietary software development contexts. The library supports integer, ﬂoating point and complex numbers, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK, or one its high-performance drop-in replacements, such as MKL from Intel or ACML from AMD. A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through C++ template meta-programming. Performance comparisons suggest that the library is considerably faster than Matlab and Octave, as well as previous C++ libraries such as IT++ and Newmat. This report reﬂects a subset of the functionality present in Armadillo v2.4.},

We model such devices as a dielectric rod and analyze the vector wave- equation for an infinite dielectric rod with arbitrary cross-section. Analytic results for the resonance condition and polarization properties are given for the cylinder. With the parabolic equation method we derive the resonance condition and the polarization properties for modes related to 2d stable periodic ray orbits. The po- larization of hybrid emitting modes of cylindrical resonators is shown to be linear up to a polarization critical angle and elliptical beyond this angle, which always lies between the Brewster and the total-internal-reflection angles of the dielectric. Arbitrary cross-sections in general give rise to non-integrable ray dynamics. We review classical Hamiltonian dynamics and billiards and expand the theory to di- electric billiards. Analysis of periodic ray orbit bifurcations and unstable manifolds enables us to understand the emission directionality of differently deformed polymer microlasers. We report new experiments on the first whispering gallery laser from a resonator with a single reflection symmetry axis, and analyze a number of different Gallium Nitride resonators/ lasers.},

We show, for different deformations of the ellipse, quadrupole and hexadecapole, that the large differences in the far-field emission patterns are explained by the differing ray dynamics corresponding to each shape. Analyzing the differences in the appropriate phase space for ray motion, it is shown that the differing geometries of the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits are the decisive factors in determining the far-field pattern. Surprisingly, we find that strongly chaotic ray dynamics is compatible with highly directional emission in the far field.},

In this approach, a continuum of the radiation wave is recomposed into a set of the newly defined spectral composite modes, each of which carries a finite magnitude of radiation power. These new modes, in conjunction with surface modes, construct the complete orthonormal set for expressing an arbitrary local field on a dielectric slab waveguide. This leads to an equivalent network approach effective for solving discontinuity problems, even on an open waveguide using the conventional method for closed-waveguide problems.

@article{SHI2012,
abstract = {We discuss three aspects of the analysis of the quasi-bound-state (QBS) or resonance-state effects on multichannel continuum wavefunctions for few-body atomic systems. Section 1 is devoted to a brief introductory account of the basic concept necessary for understanding the later sections. General properties of the scattering matrix S and a related time-delay matrix Q are discussed in Section 2. Both isolated and overlapping resonances are treated, starting from single-channel problems and extending the theory for multichannel cases. Useful relations are derived in detail on the basis of linear algebra. The concept of the resonance channel and nonresonance channel spaces, separated from each other, is introduced via the Q-matrix diagonalization. Outstanding examples of resonance analysis by the inspection of the eigenvalues of the Q matrix are presented. They include the extraction of resonances from a monotonically decreasing phase shift due to a strong background, the detection of a weak resonance, seemingly a nearly constant background behind a strong resonance, and the decomposition of several overlapping resonances into the individual components, some of which are difficult to identify by the conventional methods. Section 3 examines effective potentials for understanding QBSs. First, the information obtainable from the asymptotic long-range potentials is summarized. This includes the analysis of infinite series of QBSs supported by an attractive Coulomb or dipole potential, the latter appearing in charged-particle collisions with hydrogen-like atoms. The infinite series of dipole-supported QBSs is terminated to only a few resonances, sometimes to one or two, by correcting for relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects. The dipole potential can also cause the background phase shift to diverge as the energy tends to a channel threshold from above, complicating a resonance structure. The hyperspherical coordinate approach is then briefly discussed. Accurate numerical calculations for three-body systems are possible by solving coupled-channel equations in terms of these coordinates. The resultant resonance structures can be visually and qualitatively interpreted by inspecting the adiabatic potentials with the hyperradius adopted as the adiabatic parameter. Sometimes the adiabatic correction or diabatic connection, or both are necessary for proper resonance analysis. By combining with the knowledge of the long-range potentials, resonances can often be ascribed to particular adiabatic or diabatic hyperspherical potentials out of an intertwined set of potential curves. In particular, when two or more adiabatic potentials exhibit strongly avoided crossings, some resonances appear as if they were associated with no hyperspherical potentials, even though a careful diabatic interpretation can clearly explain them. A shift in hyperspherical potentials with a continuous change in some parameter(s) in the system can result in a sudden change from a bound state to QBS or from a Feshbach to shape resonance without any essential change in the main part of the wavefunction. Section 4 analyzes the energy dependence of the cross sections near the threshold for the formation of a QBS. The Wigner threshold law breaks down close to the threshold since the threshold itself has an uncertainty due to the finite lifetime of the QBS. The modifications, due to Baz', for a blurred threshold are explained. Positron–atom collisions are discussed as a prototype, where a bound electron–positron pair (positronium, Ps) can be formed. It is a QBS since it annihilates eventually. Pair annihilation, or positron absorption, can also occur during the collision. The conventional theory leads to a divergent positron absorption cross section at the Ps formation threshold Eth, and to a Ps formation cross section starting from zero and rapidly increasing above Eth. Both of these processes have a common final channel of pair annihilation and should be treated collectively. This is possible by phenomenologically modeling pair annihilation as particle loss due to an imaginary potential in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This approach proves the continuous and smooth transition from positron absorption to Ps formation across Eth, following the Baz' threshold law. Thus, the two processes are indistinguishable in the energy region of this transition.},

abstract = {The concept of 'resonance channel space' is proposed. Resonance states can decay into any open channels of common symmetry. They can also decay into any of the eigenchannels defined by diagonalizing the S matrix. However, an isolated resonance is known to decay only into a particular one of the eigenchannels (referred to as Q -eigenchannels) defined by diagonalizing the time-delay matrx \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/44/20/201002/jpb403424ieqn1.gif] \{Q=$\backslash$mathrm\{i\}$\backslash$hspace\{0.56917pt\} $\backslash$hbar S $\backslash$mathrm\{d\}S\^{}\{$\backslash$dag \}$\backslash$hspace\{-1.9919pt\}/$\backslash$mathrm\{d\}E\} , where the dagger indicates the Hermitian conjugate. This particular Q -eigenchannel corresponds to the eigenvalue of Lorentzian shape as a function of the energy E . A theorem generalizing this for N overlapping resonances is proved; only N eigenvalues of the Q matrix are nonzero and exhibit N Lorentzian profiles, avoiding each other around their crossing points, provided that the background S matrix is independent of E . Any of the overlapping resonances can decay only into the N Q -eigenchannels corresponding to these eigenvalues, and not to any other Q -eigenchannels. Thus, the set of Q -eigenchannels can be divided into 'resonance channel space', i.e. the subset of N Q -eigenchannels associated with the resonances and its complement completely irrelevant to the resonances asymptotically.},

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a useful algorithm to optimize the shape of asymmetric resonant cavities (ARCs). At first, we studied the repeatability and accuracy of the ray simulation on one kind of ARCs (half-quadrupole-half-circle shaped cavity), and confirmed the robustness of the directionality under shape errors. Based on these, we proposed a hill-climbing algorithm to optimize the ARCs for unidirectional emission. Different evaluation functions of directionality were tested and we suggested using the function of energy contained in a certain angle for highly collimated and unidirectional emission. By this method, we optimized the ARCs to obtain about 0.46 of the total radiated energy in divergence angle of 40° in the far field. This optimization method is very powerful for the shape engineering of ARCs and could be applied in future studies of ARCs with specific emission properties.},

abstract = {The duration of a collision is usually a rather ill-defined concept, depending on a more or less arbitrary choice of a collision distance. If the collision lifetime is defined as the limit, as R→∞, of the difference between the time the particles spend within a distance R of each other and the time they would have spent there in the absence of the interaction, a well-defined quantity emerges which is finite as long as the interaction vanishes rapidly enough at large R.In quantum mechanics, using steady-state wave functions, the average time of residence in a region is the integrated density divided by the total flux in (or out), and the lifetime is defined as the difference between these residence times with and without interaction. Transformation properties require construction of the lifetime matrix, Q. If the wave functions $\psi$i are normalized to unit total flux in and out through a sphere at R→∞, the matrix elements are Qij=limit of [∫r<R$\psi$i$\psi$j*d$\tau$-R(vi-1$\delta$ij+$\Sigma$kSikvk-1Sjk*)]Av as R→∞, where the average value is taken to eliminate oscillating terms at large R, Sik is an element of the unitary scattering matrix, S, and vi is the velocity in the ith channel. Q is Hermitian; a diagonal element Qii is the average lifetime of a collision beginning in the ith channel. As a function of the energy Q is related to S: Q=-iℏS dS†/dE; Q and S contain the same information, from complementary points of view. When Q is diagonalized, its proper values, qii, are the lifetimes of metastable states if they are large compared to ℏ/E; for a sharp resonance, the measured lifetime is the average of qii(E) over a distribution in energy. The corresponding eigenfunctions, $\Psi$i, are the proper functions to describe these metastable states. The causality principle appears directly from an inequality involving the integral expression for Qii or qii, and it is shown how some of its consequences for inelastic collisions can be deduced.},

While whispering-gallery modes based UV lasers have been successfully obtained in GaN, ZnO nanorods, and nanopillars, the reported thresholds are still very high, due to the low-quality (Q) factors of the hexagonal resonances. Here we demonstrate resonances whose Q factors can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than the hexagonal modes, promising the reduction of the energy consumption. The key to our finding is the avoided resonance crossing between superscar states along two sets of nearly degenerated triangle orbits, which leads to the formation of hexagram modes. The mode couplings suppress the field distributions at the corners and the deviations from triangle orbits simultaneously and therefore enhance the Q factors significantly.},

abstract = {Dielectric optical micro-resonators and micro-lasers represent a realization of a wave- chaotic system, where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape leads to non- integrable ray dynamics in the short-wavelength limit. Understanding and controlling the emission properties of such resonators requires the investigation of the correspon- dence between classical phase space structures of the ray motion inside the resonator and wave-functions. Semi-classical approaches to the resonances of deformed cylin- drical resonators are analyzed first within the closed limit, which corresponds to the quantum billiard problem from the field of quantum chaos. The results are then generalized to the dielectric case. We develop an efficient numerical algorithm to calculate the quasi-bound modes of dielectric resonators, which play a crucial role in determining the emission properties of micro-lasers based on dielectric resonators. Resonances based on stable periodic ray orbits of dielectric cavities are constructed in the short-wavelength limit using the parabolic equation method, and an asso- ciated wavevector quantization rule for the complex wavenumbers is derived. The effect of discrete symmetries of the resonator is analyzed and shown to give rise to quasi-degenerate multiplets. A recent experiment on lasing emission from deformed GaN micro-cavities is analyzed, leading to the appearance of scarred modes and non-specular effects in the farfield emission pattern. A framework is presented for treating the non-linear laser equations in a form suitable for treating the dielectric micro-lasers.},

When excited by a focused laser beam, the induced transparency in the transmission spectrum originates from the destructive interference of two parallel optical pathways: (i) directly refractive excitation of the chaotic modes, and (ii) excitation of the ultra-high-Q regular mode via chaos-assisted dynamical tunneling mechanism coupling back to the chaotic modes. By controlling the focal position of the laser beam, the induced transparency experiences a highly tunable Fano-like asymmetric lineshape. The experimental results are modeled by a quantum scattering theory and show excellent agreement. This chaos-induced transparency is accompanied by extremely steep normal dispersion, and may open up new possibilities a dramatic slow light behavior and a significant enhancement of nonlinear interactions.},

abstract = {The manner in which states of some quantum systems become effectively classical is of great significance for the foundations of quantum physics, as well as for problems of practical interest such as quantum engineering. In the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that many (perhaps all) of the symptoms of classicality can be induced in quantum systems by their environments. Thus decoherence is caused by the interaction in which the environment in effect monitors certain observables of the system, destroying coherence between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly nonlocal “Schr\"{o}dinger-cat states.” The classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit. Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation. Only the preferred pointer observable of the apparatus can store information that has predictive power. When the measured quantum system is microscopic and isolated, this restriction on the predictive utility of its correlations with the macroscopic apparatus results in the effective “collapse of the wave packet.” The existential interpretation implied by einselection regards observers as open quantum systems, distinguished only by their ability to acquire, store, and process information. Spreading of the correlations with the effectively classical pointer states throughout the environment allows one to understand “classical reality” as a property based on the relatively objective existence of the einselected states. Effectively classical pointer states can be “found out” without being re-prepared, e.g, by intercepting the information already present in the environment. The redundancy of the records of pointer states in the environment (which can be thought of as their “fitness” in the Darwinian sense) is a measure of their classicality. A new symmetry appears in this setting. Environment-assisted invariance or envariance sheds new light on the nature of ignorance of the state of the system due to quantum correlations with the environment and leads to Born’s rules and to reduced density matrices, ultimately justifying basic principles of the program of decoherence and einselection.},
